    - Core SDL2 is "ready"
      - callbacks (timers, etc) work but could use more real world testing (perl really hates threadsl...)
      - test suite is not even close to being complete
    - SDL2::Mixer is incomplete but core functionality is there
    - SDL2::TTF is ready
    - SDL2::Image is ready
    - Please submit issues with tests
