    exit SDL_Quit();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SDL2::FFI is ...

This package is named C<SDL2::FFI> because C<SDL2> is being squatted on and I'd
rather make games than play them over namespaces.



=head1 Initialization and Shutdown

The functions in this category are used to set up SDL for use and generally
have global effects in your program.

=head2 C<SDL_Init( ... )>

Initialize the SDL library.

C<SDL_Init( ... )> simply forwards to calling L<< C<SDL_InitSubSystem( ...
)>|/C<SDL_InitSubSystem( ... )> >>. Therefore, the two may be used
interchangeably. Though for readability of your code L<< C<SDL_InitSubSystem(
... )>|/C<SDL_InitSubSystem( ... )> >> might be preferred.

The file I/O (for example: SDL_RWFromFile) and threading (SDL_CreateThread)
subsystems are initialized by default. Message boxes (SDL_ShowSimpleMessageBox)
also attempt to work without initializing the video subsystem, in hopes of
being useful in showing an error dialog when SDL_Init fails. You must
specifically initialize other subsystems if you use them in your application.

Logging (such as SDL_Log) works without initialization, too.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<flags> which may be any be imported with the L<< C<:init>|SDL2::FFI/C<:init> >> tag and may be OR'd together.

=back

Subsystem initialization is ref-counted, you must call L<< C<SDL_QuitSubSystem(
... )>|/C<SDL_QuitSubSystem( ... )> >> for each L<< C<SDL_InitSubSystem( ...
)>|/C<SDL_InitSubSystem( ... )> >> to correctly shutdown a subsystem manually
(or call L<< C<SDL_Quit( )>|/C<SDL_Quit( )> >> to force shutdown). If a
subsystem is already loaded then this call will increase the ref-count and
return.

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_InitSubSystem( ... )>

Compatibility function to initialize the SDL library.

In SDL2, this function and L<< C<SDL_Init( ... )>|/C<SDL_Init( ... )> >> are
interchangeable.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<flags> which may be any be imported with the L<< C<:init>|SDL2::FFI/C<:init> >> tag and may be OR'd together.

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError()>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_Quit( )>

Clean up all initialized subsystems.

You should call this function even if you have already shutdown each
initialized subsystem with L<< C<SDL_QuitSubSystem( )>|/C<SDL_QuitSubSystem( )>
>>. It is safe to call this function even in the case of errors in
initialization.

If you start a subsystem using a call to that subsystem's init function (for
example L<< C<SDL_VideoInit()>|/C<SDL_VideoInit( )> >>) instead of L<<
C<SDL_Init( ... )>|/C<SDL_Init( ... )> >> or L<< C<SDL_InitSubSystem( ...
)>|/C<SDL_InitSubSystem( ... )> >>, then you must use that subsystem's quit
function (L<< C<SDL_VideoQuit( )>|/C<SDL_VideoQuit( )> >>) to shut it down
before calling C<SDL_Quit( )>. But generally, you should not be using those
functions directly anyhow; use L<< C<SDL_Init( ... )>|/C<SDL_Init( ... )> >>
instead.

You can use this function in an C<END { ... }> block to ensure that it is run
when your application is shutdown.

=head2 C<SDL_QuitSubSystem( ... )>

Shut down specific SDL subsystems.

If you start a subsystem using a call to that subsystem's init function (for
example L<< C<SDL_VideoInit( )> |/C<SDL_VideoInit( )> >>) instead of L<<
C<SDL_Init( ... )>|/C<SDL_Init( ... )> >> or L<< C<SDL_InitSubSystem( ...
)>|/C<SDL_InitSubSystem( ... )> >>, L<< C<SDL_QuitSubSystem( ...
)>|/C<SDL_QuitSubSystem( ... )> >> and L<< C<SDL_WasInit( ...
)>|/C<SDL_WasInit( ... )> >> will not work. You will need to use that
subsystem's quit function ( L<< C<SDL_VideoQuit( )>|/C<SDL_VideoQuit( )> >>
directly instead. But generally, you should not be using those functions
directly anyhow; use L<< C<SDL_Init( ... )>|/C<SDL_Init( ... )> >> instead.

You still need to call L<< C<SDL_Quit( )>|/C<SDL_Quit( )> >> even if you close
all open subsystems with L<< C<SDL_QuitSubSystem( ... )>|/C<SDL_QuitSubSystem(
... )> >>.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<flags> which may be any be imported with the L<< C<:init>|SDL2::FFI/C<:init> >> tag and may be OR'd together.

=back

=head2 C<SDL_WasInit( ... )>

Get a mask of the specified subsystems which are currently initialized.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<flags> which may be any be imported with the L<< C<:init>|SDL2::FFI/C<:init> >> tag and may be OR'd together.

=back

If C<flags> is C<0>, it returns a mask of all initialized subsystems, otherwise
it returns the initialization status of the specified subsystems.

The return value does not include C<SDL_INIT_NOPARACHUTE>.


=head1 Configuration Variables

This category contains functions to set and get configuration hints, as well as
listing each of them alphabetically.

The convention for naming hints is C<SDL_HINT_X>, where C<SDL_X> is the
environment variable that can be used to override the default.

In general these hints are just that - they may or may not be supported or
applicable on any given platform, but they provide a way for an application or
user to give the library a hint as to how they would like the library to work.

=head2 C<SDL_SetHintWithPriority( ... )>

Set a hint with a specific priority.

	SDL_SetHintWithPriority( SDL_EVENT_LOGGING, 2, SDL_HINT_OVERRIDE );

The priority controls the behavior when setting a hint that already has a
value. Hints will replace existing hints of their priority and lower.
Environment variables are considered to have override priority.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<name>

the hint to set

=item C<value>

the value of the hint variable

=item C<priority>

the priority level for the hint

=back

Returns a true if the hint was set, untrue otherwise.

=head2 C<SDL_SetHint( ... )>

Set a hint with normal priority.

	SDL_SetHint( SDL_HINT_XINPUT_ENABLED, 1 );

Hints will not be set if there is an existing override hint or environment
variable that takes precedence. You can use SDL_SetHintWithPriority() to set
the hint with override priority instead.

Expected parameters:

=over

=item C<name>

the hint to set

=item C<value>

the value of the hint variable

=back

Returns a true value if the hint was set, untrue otherwise.

=head2 C<SDL_GetHint( ... )>

Get the value of a hint.

	SDL_GetHint( SDL_HINT_XINPUT_ENABLED );

Expected parameters:

=over

=item C<name>

the hint to query

=back

Returns the string value of a hint or an undefined value if the hint isn't set.

=head2 C<SDL_GetHintBoolean( ... )>

Get the boolean value of a hint variable.

	SDL_GetHintBoolean( SDL_HINT_XINPUT_ENABLED, 0);

Expected parameters:

=over

=item C<name>

the name of the hint to get the boolean value from

=item C<default_value>

the value to return if the hint does not exist

=back

Returns the boolean value of a hint or the provided default value if the hint
does not exist.

=head2 C<SDL_AddHintCallback( ... )>

Add a function to watch a particular hint.

	my $cb = SDL_AddHintCallback(
		SDL_HINT_XINPUT_ENABLED,
		sub {
			my ($userdata, $name, $oldvalue, $newvalue) = @_;
			...;
		},
		{ time => time(), clicks => 3 }
	);

Expected parameters:

=over

=item C<name>

the hint to watch

=item C<callback>

a code reference that will be called when the hint value changes

=item C<userdata>

a pointer to pass to the callback function

=back

Returns a pointer to a L<FFI::Platypus::Closure> which you may pass to L<<
C<SDL_DelHintCallback( ... )>|/C<SDL_DelHintCallback( ... )> >>.

=head2 C<SDL_DelHintCallback( ... )>

Remove a callback watching a particular hint.

	SDL_AddHintCallback(
		SDL_HINT_XINPUT_ENABLED,
		$cb,
		{ time => time(), clicks => 3 }
	);

Expected parameters:

=over

=item C<name>

the hint to watch

=item C<callback>

L<FFI::Platypus::Closure> object returned by L<< C<SDL_AddHintCallback( ...
)>|/C<SDL_AddHintCallback( ... )> >>

=item C<userdata>

a pointer to pass to the callback function

=back

=head2 C<SDL_ClearHints()>

Clear all hints.

	SDL_ClearHints();

This function is automatically called during L<< C<SDL_Quit( )>|/C<SDL_Quit( )>
>>.


=head1 Error Handling

Functions in this category provide simple error message routines for SDL. L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> can be called for almost all SDL
functions to determine what problems are occurring. Check the wiki page of each
specific SDL function to see whether L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )>
>> is meaningful for them or not.

The SDL error messages are in English.

=head2 C<SDL_SetError( ... )>

Set the SDL error message for the current thread.

Calling this function will replace any previous error message that was set.

This function always returns C<-1>, since SDL frequently uses C<-1> to signify
an failing result, leading to this idiom:


	if ($error_code) {
		return SDL_SetError( 'This operation has failed: %d', $error_code );
	}

Expected parameters:

=over

=item C<fmt>

a C<printf()>-style message format string

=item C<@params>

additional parameters matching % tokens in the C<fmt> string, if any

=back

=head2 C<SDL_GetError( )>

Retrieve a message about the last error that occurred on the current thread.

	warn SDL_GetError();

It is possible for multiple errors to occur before calling C<SDL_GetError()>.
Only the last error is returned.

The message is only applicable when an SDL function has signaled an error. You
must check the return values of SDL function calls to determine when to
appropriately call C<SDL_GetError()>. You should B<not> use the results of
C<SDL_GetError()> to decide if an error has occurred! Sometimes SDL will set an
error string even when reporting success.

SDL will B<not> clear the error string for successful API calls. You B<must>
check return values for failure cases before you can assume the error string
applies.

Error strings are set per-thread, so an error set in a different thread will
not interfere with the current thread's operation.

The returned string is internally allocated and must not be freed by the
application.

Returns a message with information about the specific error that occurred, or
an empty string if there hasn't been an error message set since the last call
to L<< C<SDL_ClearError()>|/C<SDL_ClearError()> >>. The message is only
applicable when an SDL function has signaled an error. You must check the
return values of SDL function calls to determine when to appropriately call
C<SDL_GetError()>.

=head2 C<SDL_GetErrorMsg( ... )>

Get the last error message that was set for the current thread.

	my $x;
	warn SDL_GetErrorMsg($x, 300);

This allows the caller to copy the error string into a provided buffer, but
otherwise operates exactly the same as L<< C<SDL_GetError()>|/C<SDL_GetError()>
>>.

=over

=item C<errstr>

A buffer to fill with the last error message that was set for the current
thread

=item C<maxlen>

The size of the buffer pointed to by the errstr parameter

=back

Returns the pointer passed in as the C<errstr> parameter.

=head2 C<SDL_ClearError( )>

Clear any previous error message for this thread.


=head1 Log Handling

Simple log messages with categories and priorities.

By default, logs are quiet but if you're debugging SDL you might want:

	SDL_LogSetAllPriority( SDL_LOG_PRIORITY_WARN );

Here's where the messages go on different platforms:

	Windows		debug output stream
	Android		log output
	Others		standard error output (STDERR)

Messages longer than the maximum size (4096 bytes) will be truncated.

=head2 C<SDL_LogSetAllPriority( ... )>

=head1 Querying SDL Version

These functions are used to collect or display information about the version of
SDL that is currently being used by the program or that it was compiled
against.

The version consists of three segments (C<X.Y.Z>)

=over

=item X - Major Version, which increments with massive changes, additions, and enhancements

=item Y - Minor Version, which increments with backwards-compatible changes to the major revision

=item Z - Patchlevel, which increments with fixes to the minor revision

=back

Example: The first version of SDL 2 was 2.0.0

The version may also be reported as a 4-digit numeric value where the thousands
place represents the major version, the hundreds place represents the minor
version, and the tens and ones places represent the patchlevel (update
version).

Example: The first version number of SDL 2 was 2000

=head2 C<SDL_GetVersion( )>

Get the version of SDL that is linked against your program.

If you are linking to SDL dynamically, then it is possible that the current
version will be different than the version you compiled against. This function
returns the current version, while SDL_VERSION() is a macro that tells you what
version you compiled with.

This function may be called safely at any time, even before L<< C<SDL_Init(
)>|/C<SDL_Init( )> >>.

Return value is a L<SDL2::FFI::Version> object.

=head1 Display and Window Management

This category contains functions for handling display and window actions.

These functions may be imported with the C<:video> tag.

=head2 C<SDL_GetNumVideoDrivers( )>

	my $num = SDL_GetNumVideoDrivers( );

Get the number of video drivers compiled into SDL.

Returns a number >= 1 on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetVideoDriver( ... )>

Get the name of a built in video driver.

    CORE::say SDL_GetVideoDriver($_) for 0 .. SDL_GetNumVideoDrivers() - 1;

The video drivers are presented in the order in which they are normally checked
during initialization.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<index> - the index of a video driver

=back

Returns the name of the video driver with the given C<index>.

=cut

=head2 C<SDL_VideoInit( ... )>

Initialize the video subsystem, optionally specifying a video driver.

	SDL_VideoInit( 'x11' );

This function initializes the video subsystem, setting up a connection to the
window manager, etc, and determines the available display modes and pixel
formats, but does not initialize a window or graphics mode.

If you use this function and you haven't used the SDL_INIT_VIDEO flag with
either SDL_Init() or SDL_InitSubSystem(), you should call SDL_VideoQuit()
before calling SDL_Quit().

It is safe to call this function multiple times. SDL_VideoInit() will call
SDL_VideoQuit() itself if the video subsystem has already been initialized.

You can use SDL_GetNumVideoDrivers() and SDL_GetVideoDriver() to find a
specific `driver_name`.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<driver_name> - the name of a video driver to initialize, or undef for the default driver

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_VideoQuit( )>

Shut down the video subsystem, if initialized with L<< C<SDL_VideoInit(
)>|/C<SDL_VideoInit( )> >>.

	SDL_VideoQuit( );

This function closes all windows, and restores the original video mode.

=head2 C<SDL_GetCurrentVideoDriver( )>

Get the name of the currently initialized video driver.

	my $driver = SDL_GetCurrentVideoDriver( );

Returns the name of the current video driver or NULL if no driver has been
initialized.

=head2 C<SDL_GetNumVideoDisplays( )>

Get the number of available video displays.

	my $screens = SDL_GetNumVideoDisplays( );

Returns a number >= 1 or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetDisplayName( ... )>


Get the name of a display in UTF-8 encoding.

	my $screen = SDL_GetDisplayName( 0 );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<displayIndex> - the index of display from which the name should be queried

=back

Returns the name of a display or undefined for an invalid display index or
failure; call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more
information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetDisplayBounds( ... )>

Get the desktop area represented by a display.

	my $rect = SDL_GetDisplayBounds( 0 );

The primary display (C<displayIndex == 0>) is always located at 0,0.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<displayIndex> - the index of the display to query

=back

Returns the SDL2::Rect structure filled in with the display bounds on success
or a negative error code on failure; call L<< C<SDL_GetError(
)>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information.


=head2 C<SDL_GetDisplayUsableBounds( ... )>

Get the usable desktop area represented by a display.

	my $rect = SDL_GetDisplayUsableBounds( 0 );

The primary display (C<displayIndex == 0>) is always located at 0,0.

This is the same area as L<< C<SDL_GetDisplayBounds( ...
)>|/C<SDL_GetDisplayBounds( ... )> >> reports, but with portions reserved by
the system removed. For example, on Apple's macOS, this subtracts the area
occupied by the menu bar and dock.

Setting a window to be fullscreen generally bypasses these unusable areas, so
these are good guidelines for the maximum space available to a non-fullscreen
window.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<displayIndex> - the index of the display to query

=back

Returns the SDL2::Rect structure filled in with the display bounds on success
or a negative error code on failure; call L<< C<SDL_GetError(
)>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information. This function also returns
C<-1> if the parameter C<displayIndex> is out of range.

=head2 C<SDL_GetDisplayDPI( ... )>

Get the dots/pixels-per-inch for a display.

	my ( $ddpi, $hdpi, $vdpi ) = SDL_GetDisplayDPI( 0 );

Diagonal, horizontal and vertical DPI can all be optionally returned if the
appropriate parameter is non-NULL.

A failure of this function usually means that either no DPI information is
available or the C<displayIndex> is out of range.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<displayIndex> - the index of the display from which DPI information should be queried

=back

Returns C<[ddpi, hdpi, vdip]> on success or a negative error code on failure;
call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information.

C<ddpi> is the diagonal DPI of the display, C<hdpi> is the horizontal DPI of
the display, C<vdpi> is the vertical DPI of the display.

=head2 C<SDL_GetDisplayOrientation( ... )>

Get the orientation of a display.

	my $orientation = SDL_GetDisplayOrientation( 0 );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<displayIndex> - the index of the display to query

=back

Returns a value which may be imported with C<:displayOrientation> or
C<SDL_ORIENTATION_UNKNOWN> if it isn't available.

=head2 C<SDL_GetNumDisplayModes( ... )>

Get the number of available display modes.

	my $modes = SDL_GetNumDisplayModes( 0 );

The C<displayIndex> needs to be in the range from C<0> to
C<SDL_GetNumVideoDisplays( ) - 1>.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<displayIndex> - the index of the display to query

=back

Returns a number >= 1 on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( > >> for more information.


=head2 C<SDL_GetDisplayMode( ... )>

Get information about a specific display mode.

	my $mode = SDL_GetDisplayMode( 0, 0 );

The display modes are sorted in this priority:

=over

=item width - largest to smallest

=item height - largest to smallest

=item bits per pixel - more colors to fewer colors

=item packed pixel layout - largest to smallest

=item refresh rate - highest to lowest

=back

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<displayIndex> - the index of the display to query

=item C<modeIndex> - the index of the display mode to query

=back

Returns an L<SDL2::DisplayMode> structure filled in with the mode at
C<modeIndex> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetDesktopDisplayMode( ... )>

Get information about the desktop's display mode.

	my $mode = SDL_GetDesktopDisplayMode( 0 );

There's a difference between this function and L<< C<SDL_GetCurrentDisplayMode(
... )>|/C<SDL_GetCurrentDisplayMode( ... )> >> when SDL runs fullscreen and has
changed the resolution. In that case this function will return the previous
native display mode, and not the current display mode.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<displayIndex> - the index of the display to query

=back

Returns an L<SDL2::DisplayMode> structure filled in with the current display
mode on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<< C<SDL_GetError(
)>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetCurrentDisplayMode( ... )>

	my $mode = SDL_GetCurrentDisplayMode( 0 );

There's a difference between this function and L<< C<SDL_GetDesktopDisplayMode(
... )>|/C<SDL_GetDesktopDisplayMode( ... )> >> when SDL runs fullscreen and has
changed the resolution. In that case this function will return the current
display mode, and not the previous native display mode.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<displayIndex> - the index of the display to query

=back

Returns an L<SDL2::DisplayMode> structure filled in with the current display
mode on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<< C<SDL_GetError(
)>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetClosestDisplayMode( ... )>

Get the closes match to the requested display mode.

	$mode = SDL_GetClosestDisplayMode( 0, $mode );

The available display modes are scanned and he closest mode matching the
requested mode is returned. The mode format and refresh rate default to the
desktop mode if they are set to 0. The modes are scanned with size being first
priority, format being second priority, and finally checking the refresh rate.
If all the available modes are too small, then an undefined value is returned.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<displayIndex> - index of the display to query

=item C<mode> - an L<SDL2::DisplayMode> structure containing the desired display mode

=item C<closest> - an L<SDL2::DisplayMode> structure filled in with the closest match of the available display modes

	my $index = SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex( $window );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window>	- the window to query

=back

Returns the index of the display containing the center of the window on success
or a negative error code on failure; call  L<< C<SDL_GetError(
)>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_SetWindowDisplayMode( ... )>

Set the display mode to use when a window is visible at fullscreen.

	my $ok = !SDL_SetWindowDisplayMode( $window, $mode );

This only affects the display mode used when the window is fullscreen. To
change the window size when the window is not fullscreen, use L<<
C<SDL_SetWindowSize( ... )>|/C<SDL_SetWindowSize( ... )> >>.

=head2 C<SDL_GetWindowDisplayMode( ... )>

Query the display mode to use when a window is visible at fullscreen.

	my $mode = SDL_GetWindowDisplayMode( $window );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window to query

=back

Returns a L<SDL2::DisplayMode> structure on success or a negative error code on
failure; call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more
information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetWindowPixelFormat( ... )>

Get teh pixel format associated with the window.

	my $format = SDL_GetWindowPixelFormat( $window );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window to query

Create a window with the specified position, dimensions, and flags.

    my $window = SDL_CreateWindow( 'Example',
        SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED, SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED,
        1280, 720,
      	SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN
    );

C<flags> may be any of the following OR'd together:

=over

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN> - fullscreen window

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP> - fullscreen window at desktop resolution

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL> - window usable with an OpenGL context

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN> - window usable with a Vulkan instance

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_METAL> - window usable with a Metal instance

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_HIDDEN> - window is not visible

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_BORDERLESS> - no window decoration

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE> - window can be resized

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_MINIMIZED> - window is minimized

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_MAXIMIZED> - window is maximized

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_INPUT_GRABBED> - window has grabbed input focus

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI> - window should be created in high-DPI mode if supported (>= SDL 2.0.1)

=back

C<SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN> is ignored by C<SDL_CreateWindow( ... )>. The SDL_Window is
implicitly shown if C<SDL_WINDOW_HIDDEN> is not set. C<SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN> may be
queried later using L<< C<SDL_GetWindowFlags( ... )>|/C<SDL_GetWindowFlags( ...
)> >>.

On Apple's macOS, you B<must> set the NSHighResolutionCapable Info.plist
property to YES, otherwise you will not receive a High-DPI OpenGL canvas.

If the window is created with the C<SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI> flag, its size in
pixels may differ from its size in screen coordinates on platforms with
high-DPI support (e.g. iOS and macOS). Use L<< C<SDL_GetWindowSize( ...
)>|/C<SDL_GetWindowSize( ... )> >> to query the client area's size in screen
coordinates, and L<< C<SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize( )>|/C<SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize( )>
>> or L<< C<SDL_GetRendererOutputSize( )>|/C<SDL_GetRendererOutputSize( )> >>
to query the drawable size in pixels.

If the window is set fullscreen, the width and height parameters C<w> and C<h>
will not be used. However, invalid size parameters (e.g. too large) may still
fail. Window size is actually limited to 16384 x 16384 for all platforms at
window creation.

If the window is created with any of the C<SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL> or
C<SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN> flags, then the corresponding LoadLibrary function
(SDL_GL_LoadLibrary or SDL_Vulkan_LoadLibrary) is called and the corresponding
UnloadLibrary function is called by L<< C<SDL_DestroyWindow( ...
)>|/C<SDL_DestroyWindow( ... )> >>.

If C<SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN> is specified and there isn't a working Vulkan driver,
C<SDL_CreateWindow( ... )> will fail because L<< C<SDL_Vulkan_LoadLibrary(
)>|/C<SDL_Vulkan_LoadLibrary( )> >> will fail.

If C<SDL_WINDOW_METAL> is specified on an OS that does not support Metal,
C<SDL_CreateWindow( ... )> will fail.

On non-Apple devices, SDL requires you to either not link to the Vulkan loader
or link to a dynamic library version. This limitation may be removed in a
future version of SDL.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<title> - the title of the window, in UTF-8 encoding

=item C<w> - the width of the window, in screen coordinates

=item C<h> - the height of the window, in screen coordinates

=item C<flags> - 0, or one or more C<SDL_WindowFlags> OR'd together

The window size in screen coordinates may differ from the size in pixels, if
the window was created with C<SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI> on a platform with
high-dpi support (e.g. iOS or macOS). Use L<< C<SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize( ...
)>|C<SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize( ... )> >> or L<< C<SDL_GetRendererOutputSize( ...
)>|/C<SDL_GetRendererOutputSize( ... )> >> to get the real client area size in

Note: If this function fails (returns -1), the size values will be initialized
to C<0, 0, 0, 0>, as if the window in question was borderless.

Note: This function may fail on systems where the window has not yet been
decorated by the display server (for example, immediately after calling L<<
C<SDL_CreateWindow( ...  )>|/C<SDL_CreateWindow( ...  )> >> ). It is
recommended that you wait at least until the window has been presented and

=head2 C<SDL_SetWindowBrightness( ... )>

Set the brightness (gamma multiplier) for a given window's display.

	my $ok = !SDL_SetWindowBrightness( $window, 2 );

Despite the name and signature, this method sets the brightness of the entire
display, not an individual window. A window is considered to be owned by the
display that contains the window's center pixel. (The index of this display can
be retrieved using L<< C<SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex( ...
)>|/C<SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex( ... )> >>.) The brightness set will not follow
the window if it is moved to another display.

Many platforms will refuse to set the display brightness in modern times. You
are better off using a shader to adjust gamma during rendering, or something
similar.

Expected parameters includes:

the display that contains the window's center pixel. (The index of this display
can be retrieved using L<< C<SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex( ...
)>|/C<SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex( ... )> >>.)

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<modal_window> - the window that should be set modal

=item C<parent_window> - the parent window for the modal window

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more information.


=head2 C<SDL_SetWindowInputFocus( ... )>

Explicitly set input focus to the window.

	SDL_SetWindowInputFocus( $window );

You almost certainly want L<< C<SDL_RaiseWindow( ... )>|/C<SDL_RaiseWindow( ...
)> >> instead of this function. Use this with caution, as you might give focus
to a window that is completely obscured by other windows.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window that should get the input focus

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_SetWindowGammaRamp( ... )>

Set the gamma ramp for the display that owns a given window.

	my $ok = !SDL_SetWindowGammaRamp( $window, \@red, \@green, \@blue );

Set the gamma translation table for the red, green, and blue channels of the
video hardware. Each table is an array of 256 16-bit quantities, representing a
mapping between the input and output for that channel. The input is the index
into the array, and the output is the 16-bit gamma value at that index, scaled
to the output color precision. Despite the name and signature, this method sets
the gamma ramp of the entire display, not an individual window. A window is
considered to be owned by the display that contains the window's center pixel.
(The index of this display can be retrieved using L<<
C<SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex( ... )>|/C<SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex( ... )> >>.)
The gamma ramp set will not follow the window if it is moved to another
display.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window used to select the display whose gamma ramp will be changed

=item C<red> - a 256 element array of 16-bit quantities representing the translation table for the red channel, or NULL

=item C<green> - a 256 element array of 16-bit quantities representing the translation table for the green channel, or NULL

=item C<blue> - a 256 element array of 16-bit quantities representing the translation table for the blue channel, or NULL

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetWindowGammaRamp( ... )>

Get the gamma ramp for a given window's display.

	my ($red, $green, $blue) = SDL_GetWindowGammaRamp( $window );

Despite the name and signature, this method retrieves the gamma ramp of the
entire display, not an individual window. A window is considered to be owned by
the display that contains the window's center pixel. (The index of this display
can be retrieved using L<< C<SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex( ...
)>|/C<SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex( ... )> >>.)

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window used to select the display whose gamma ramp will be queried

=back

Returns three 256 element arrays of 16-bit quantities filled in with the
translation table for the red, gree, and blue channels on success or a negative
error code on failure; call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for
more information.

=head2 C<SDL_SetWindowHitTest( ... )>

Provide a callback that decides if a window region has special properties.

	SDL_SetWindowHitTest( $window, sub ($win, $point, $data) {
    	warn sprintf 'Click at x:%d y:%d', $point->x, $point->y;
    	...;
	});

Normally, windows are dragged and resized by decorations provided by the system
window manager (a title bar, borders, etc), but for some apps, it makes sense
to drag them from somewhere else inside the window itself; for example, one
might have a borderless window that wants to be draggable from any part, or
simulate its own title bar, etc.

This function lets the app provide a callback that designates pieces of a given
window as special. This callback is run during event processing if we need to
tell the OS to treat a region of the window specially; the use of this callback
is known as "hit testing."

Mouse input may not be delivered to your application if it is within a special
area; the OS will often apply that input to moving the window or resizing the
window and not deliver it to the application.

Specifying undef for a callback disables hit-testing. Hit-testing is disabled
by default.

Platforms that don't support this functionality will return C<-1>
unconditionally, even if you're attempting to disable hit-testing.

Your callback may fire at any time, and its firing does not indicate any
specific behavior (for example, on Windows, this certainly might fire when the
OS is deciding whether to drag your window, but it fires for lots of other
reasons, too, some unrelated to anything you probably care about B<and when the
mouse isn't actually at the location it is testing>). Since this can fire at
any time, you should try to keep your callback efficient, devoid of
allocations, etc.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window to set hit-testing on

=item C<callback> - the function to call when doing a hit-test

=item C<callback_data> - an app-defined void pointer passed to C<callback>

=back

Returns C<0> on success or C<-1> on error (including unsupported); call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_FlashWindow( ... )>

Request a window to give a signal, e.g. a visual signal, to demand attention
from the user.

	SDL_FlashWindow( $window, 10 );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window to request the flashing for

=item C<flash_count> - number of times the window gets flashed on systems that support flashing the window multiple times, like Windows, else it is ignored

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_DestroyWindow( ... )>

Destroy a window.

	SDL_DestoryWindow( $window );

If C<window> is undefined, this function will return immediately after setting
the SDL error message to "Invalid window". See L<< C<SDL_GetError(
)>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>().

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window to destroy

=back

=head2 C<SDL_IsScreenSaverEnabled( ... )>

Check whether the screensaver is currently enabled.

	my $enabled = SDL_IsScreenSaverEnabled( );

The screensaver is disabled by default since SDL 2.0.2. Before SDL 2.0.2 the
screensaver was enabled by default.

The default can also be changed using C<SDL_HINT_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER>.

Returns true if the screensaver is enabled, false if it is disabled.

=head2 C<SDL_EnableScreenSaver( ... )>

Allow the screen to be blanked by a screen saver.

	SDL_EnableScreenSaver( );


=head2 C<SDL_DisableScreenSaver( ... )>

Prevent the screen from being blanked by a screen saver.

	SDL_DisableScreenSaver( );

If you disable the screensaver, it is automatically re-enabled when SDL quits.

=head1 OpenGL Support Functions

These may be imported with the C<:opengl> tag.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_LoadLibrary( ... )>

Dynamically load an OpenGL library.

	my $ok = SDL_GL_LoadLibrary( );

This should be done after initializing the video driver, but before creating
any OpenGL windows. If no OpenGL library is loaded, the default library will be
loaded upon creation of the first OpenGL window.

If you do this, you need to retrieve all of the GL functions used in your
program from the dynamic library using L<< C<SDL_GL_GetProcAddress(
)>|/C<SDL_GL_GetProcAddress( )> >>.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<path> - the platform dependent OpenGL library name, or undef to open the default OpenGL library

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_GetProcAddress( ... )>

Get an OpenGL function by name.

	my $ptr = SDL_GL_GetProcAddress( 'glGenBuffers' );
	...; # TODO
	# TODO: In the future, this should return an XSUB loaded with FFI.

If the GL library is loaded at runtime with L<< C<SDL_GL_LoadLibrary( ...
)>|/C<SDL_GL_LoadLibrary( ... )> >>, then all GL functions must be retrieved
this way. Usually this is used to retrieve function pointers to OpenGL
extensions.

There are some quirks to looking up OpenGL functions that require some extra
care from the application. If you code carefully, you can handle these quirks
without any platform-specific code, though:

=over

=item * On Windows, function pointers are specific to the current GL context;
this means you need to have created a GL context and made it current before
calling SDL_GL_GetProcAddress(). If you recreate your context or create a
second context, you should assume that any existing function pointers
aren't valid to use with it. This is (currently) a Windows-specific
limitation, and in practice lots of drivers don't suffer this limitation,
but it is still the way the wgl API is documented to work and you should
expect crashes if you don't respect it. Store a copy of the function
pointers that comes and goes with context lifespan.

=item * On X11, function pointers returned by this function are valid for any
context, and can even be looked up before a context is created at all. This
means that, for at least some common OpenGL implementations, if you look up
a function that doesn't exist, you'll get a non-NULL result that is _NOT_
safe to call. You must always make sure the function is actually available
for a given GL context before calling it, by checking for the existence of
the appropriate extension with L<< C<SDL_GL_ExtensionSupported( ... )>|C<SDL_GL_ExtensionSupported( ... )> >>, or verifying
that the version of OpenGL you're using offers the function as core
functionality.

=item * Some OpenGL drivers, on all platforms, B<will> return undef if a function
isn't supported, but you can't count on this behavior. Check for extensions
you use, and if you get an undef anyway, act as if that extension wasn't
available. This is probably a bug in the driver, but you can code
defensively for this scenario anyhow.

=item * Just because you're on Linux/Unix, don't assume you'll be using X11.
Next-gen display servers are waiting to replace it, and may or may not make
the same promises about function pointers.

=item * OpenGL function pointers must be declared C<APIENTRY> as in the example
code. This will ensure the proper calling convention is followed on
platforms where this matters (Win32) thereby avoiding stack corruption.

=back

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<proc> - the name of an OpenGL function

=back

Returns a pointer to the named OpenGL function. The returned pointer should be
cast to the appropriate function signature.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_UnloadLibrary( )>

Unload the OpenGL library previously loaded by L<< C<SDL_GL_LoadLibrary( ...
)>|/C<SDL_GL_LoadLibrary( ... )> >>.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_ExtensionSupported( ... )>

Check if an OpenGL extension is supported for the current context.

	my $ok = SDL_GL_ExtensionSupported( 'GL_ARB_texture_rectangle' );

This function operates on the current GL context; you must have created a
context and it must be current before calling this function. Do not assume that
all contexts you create will have the same set of extensions available, or that
recreating an existing context will offer the same extensions again.

While it's probably not a massive overhead, this function is not an O(1)
operation. Check the extensions you care about after creating the GL context
and save that information somewhere instead of calling the function every time
you need to know.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<extension> - the name of the extension to check

=back

Returns true if the extension is supported, false otherwise.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_ResetAttributes( )>

Reset all previously set OpenGL context attributes to their default values.

	SDL_GL_ResetAttributes( );

=head2 C<SDL_GL_SetAttribute( ... )>

Set an OpenGL window attribute before window creation.

	SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_RED_SIZE, 5);
	SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_GREEN_SIZE, 5);
	SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_BLUE_SIZE, 5);
	SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_DEPTH_SIZE, 16);
	SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_DOUBLEBUFFER, 1);

This function sets the OpenGL attribute C<attr> to C<value>. The requested
attributes should be set before creating an OpenGL window. You should use L<<
C<SDL_GL_GetAttribute( ... )>|/C<SDL_GL_GetAttribute( ... )> >> to check the
values after creating the OpenGL context, since the values obtained can differ
from the requested ones.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<attr> - an SDL_GLattr enum value specifying the OpenGL attribute to set

=item C<value> - the desired value for the attribute

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_GetAttribute( ... )>

Get the actual value for an attribute from the current context.

	my $value = SDL_GL_GetAttribute(SDL_GL_DOUBLEBUFFER);

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<attr> - an SDL_GLattr enum value specifying the OpenGL attribute to get

=back

Returns the value on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_CreateContext( ... )>

Create an OpenGL context for an OpenGL window, and make it current.

	# Window mode MUST include SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL for use with OpenGL.
	my $window = SDL_CreateWindow(
    	'SDL2/OpenGL Demo', 0, 0, 640, 480, 
    	SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL|SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE);
  
	# Create an OpenGL context associated with the window
	my $glcontext = SDL_GL_CreateContext( $window );

	# now you can make GL calls.
	glClearColor( 0, 0, 0 ,1 );
	glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT );
	SDL_GL_SwapWindow( $window );

	# Once finished with OpenGL functions, the SDL_GLContext can be deleted.
	SDL_GL_DeleteContext( $glcontext );

Windows users new to OpenGL should note that, for historical reasons, GL
functions added after OpenGL version 1.1 are not available by default. Those
functions must be loaded at run-time, either with an OpenGL extension-handling
library or with L<< C<SDL_GL_GetProcAddress( ... )>|/C<SDL_GL_GetProcAddress(
... )> >> and its related functions.

SDL::GLContext is opaque to the application.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window to associate with the context

=back

Returns the OpenGL context associated with C<window> or undef on error; call
L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more details.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_MakeCurrent( ... )>

Set up an OpenGL context for rendering into an OpenGL window.

	SDL_GL_MakeCurrent( $window, $gl );

The context must have been created with a compatible window.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window to associate with the context

=item C<context> - the OpenGL context to associate with the window

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_GetCurrentWindow( )>

Get the currently active OpenGL window.

	my $window = SDL_GL_GetCurrentWindow( );

Returns the currently active OpenGL window on success or undef on failure; call
L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_GetCurrentContext( )>

Get the currently active OpenGL context.

	my $gl = SDL_GL_GetCurrentContext( );

Returns the currently active OpenGL context or NULL on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize( ... )>

Get the size of a window's underlying drawable in pixels.

	my ($w, $h) = SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize( $window );

This returns info useful for calling C<glViewport( ... )>.

This may differ from L<< C<SDL_GetWindowSize( ... )>|/C<SDL_GetWindowSize( ...
)> >> if we're rendering to a high-DPI drawable, i.e. the window was created
with C<SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI> on a platform with high-DPI support (Apple
calls this "Retina"), and not disabled by the
C<SDL_HINT_VIDEO_HIGHDPI_DISABLED> hint.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window from which the drawable size should be queried

=back

Returns the width and height in pixels, either of which may be undefined.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_SetSwapInterval( ... )>

Set the swap interval for the current OpenGL context.

	my $ok = !SDL_GL_SetSwapInterval( 1 );

Some systems allow specifying C<-1> for the interval, to enable adaptive vsync.
Adaptive vsync works the same as vsync, but if you've already missed the
vertical retrace for a given frame, it swaps buffers immediately, which might
be less jarring for the user during occasional framerate drops. If application
requests adaptive vsync and the system does not support it, this function will
fail and return C<-1>. In such a case, you should probably retry the call with
C<1> for the interval.

Adaptive vsync is implemented for some glX drivers with
C<GLX_EXT_swap_control_tear>:
L<https://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/glx_swap_control_tear.txt> and for
some Windows drivers with C<WGL_EXT_swap_control_tear>:
L<https://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/wgl_swap_control_tear.txt>

Read more on the Khronos wiki:
L<https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Swap_Interval#Adaptive_Vsync>

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<interval> - 0 for immediate updates, 1 for updates synchronized with the vertical retrace, -1 for adaptive vsync

=back

Returns C<0> on success or C<-1> if setting the swap interval is not supported;
call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_GetSwapInterval( )>

Get the swap interval for the current OpenGL context.

	my $interval = SDL_GL_GetSwapInterval( );

If the system can't determine the swap interval, or there isn't a valid current
context, this function will return 0 as a safe default.

Returns C<0> if there is no vertical retrace synchronization, C<1> if the
buffer swap is synchronized with the vertical retrace, and C<-1> if late swaps
happen immediately instead of waiting for the next retrace; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_SwapWindow( ... )>

Update a window with OpenGL rendering.

	SDL_GL_SwapWindow( $window );

This is used with double-buffered OpenGL contexts, which are the default.

On macOS, make sure you bind 0 to the draw framebuffer before swapping the
window, otherwise nothing will happen. If you aren't using C<glBindFramebuffer(
)>, this is the default and you won't have to do anything extra.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window to change

=back

=head2 C<SDL_GL_DeleteContext( ... )>

Delete an OpenGL context.

	SDL_GL_DeleteContext( $context );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<context> - the OpenGL context to be deleted

=back

=head2 2D Accelerated Rendering

This category contains functions for 2D accelerated rendering. You may import
these functions with the C<:rendering> tag.

This API supports the following features:

=over

=item single pixel points

=item single pixel lines

=item filled rectangles

=item texture images

=back

All of these may be drawn in opaque, blended, or additive modes.

The texture images can have an additional color tint or alpha modulation
applied to them, and may also be stretched with linear interpolation, rotated
or flipped/mirrored.

For advanced functionality like particle effects or actual 3D you should use
SDL's OpenGL/Direct3D support or one of the many available 3D engines.

This API is not designed to be used from multiple threads, see L<SDL issue
#986|https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/986> for details.

=head2 C<SDL_GetNumRenderDrivers( )>

Get the number of 2D rendering drivers available for the current display.

	my $drivers = SDL_GetNumRenderDrivers( );

A render driver is a set of code that handles rendering and texture management
on a particular display. Normally there is only one, but some drivers may have
several available with different capabilities.

There may be none if SDL was compiled without render support.

Returns an L<SDL2::RendererInfo> structure on success or a negative error code
on failure; call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more
information.

=head2 C<SDL_CreateWindowAndRenderer( ... )>

Create a window and default renderer.

	my ($window, $renderer) = SDL_CreateWindowAndRenderer(640, 480, 0);

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<width> - the width of the window

=item C<height> - the height of the window

=item C<window_flags> - the flags used to create the window (see L<< C<SDL_CreateWindow( ... )>|/C<SDL_CreateWindow( ... )> >>)

=back

Returns a L<SDL2::Window> and L<SDL2::Renderer> objects on success, or -1 on
error; call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more
information.

=head2 C<SDL_CreateRenderer( ... )>

Create a 2D rendering context for a window.

	my $renderer = SDL_CreateRenderer( $window, -1, 0);

Expected parameters include:

=item C<flags> - C<0>, or one or more C<SDL_RendererFlags> OR'd together

=back

Returns a valid rendering context or undefined if there was an error; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_CreateSoftwareRenderer( ... )>

Create a 2D software rendering context for a surface.

	my $renderer = SDL_CreateSoftwareRenderer( $surface );

Two other API which can be used to create SDL_Renderer:

L<< C<SDL_CreateRenderer( ... )>|/C<SDL_CreateRenderer( ... )> >> and L<<
C<SDL_CreateWindowAndRenderer( ... )>|/C<SDL_CreateWindowAndRenderer( ... )>
>>. These can B<also> create a software renderer, but they are intended to be
used with an L<SDL2::Window> as the final destination and not an
L<SDL2::Surface>.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<surface> - the L<SDL2::Surface> structure representing the surface where rendering is done

=back

Returns a valid rendering context or undef if there was an error; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetRenderer( ... )>

Get the renderer associated with a window.

	my $renderer = SDL_GetRenderer( $window );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window to query

=back

Returns the rendering context on success or undef on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetRendererInfo( ... )>

Get information about a rendering context.

	my $info = !SDL_GetRendererInfo( $renderer );

Expected parameters include:

on failure; call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more
information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetRendererOutputSize( ... )>

Get the output size in pixels of a rendering context.

	my ($w, $h) = SDL_GetRendererOutputSize( $renderer );

Due to high-dpi displays, you might end up with a rendering context that has
more pixels than the window that contains it, so use this instead of L<<
C<SDL_GetWindowSize( ... )>|/C<SDL_GetWindowSize( ... )> >> to decide how much
drawing area you have.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - the rendering context

=back

Returns the width and height on success or a negative error code on failure;
call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more information.

Create a texture for a rendering context.

    my $texture = SDL_CreateTexture( $renderer, SDL_PIXELFORMAT_RGBA8888, SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_TARGET, 1024, 768);

=for TODO: https://gist.github.com/malja/2193bd656fe50c203f264ce554919976    

You can set the texture scaling method by setting
C<SDL_HINT_RENDER_SCALE_QUALITY> before creating the texture.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - the rendering context

=item C<format> - one of the enumerated values in C<:pixelFormatEnum>

=item C<access> - one of the enumerated values in C<:textureAccess>

=item C<w> - the width of the texture in pixels

=item C<h> - the height of the texture in pixels

=back

Returns a pointer to the created texture or undefined if no rendering context
was active, the format was unsupported, or the width or height were out of
range; call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more
information.

=head2 C<SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface( ... )>

Create a texture from an existing surface.

	use Config;
	my ($rmask, $gmask, $bmask, $amask) = 
	$Config{byteorder} == 4321 ? (0xff000000,0x00ff0000,0x0000ff00,0x000000ff) :
    							 (0x000000ff,0x0000ff00,0x00ff0000,0xff000000);
	my $surface = SDL_CreateRGBSurface( 0, 640, 480, 32, $rmask, $gmask, $bmask, $amask );
	my $texture = SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface( $renderer, $surface );

The surface is not modified or freed by this function.

The SDL_TextureAccess hint for the created texture is
C<SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STATIC>.

The pixel format of the created texture may be different from the pixel format
of the surface. Use L<< C<SDL_QueryTexture( ... )>|/C<SDL_QueryTexture( ... )>
>> to query the pixel format of the texture.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - the rendering context

=item C<surface> - the L<SDL2::Surface> structure containing pixel data used to fill the texture

=back

Returns the created texture or undef on failure; call L<< C<SDL_GetError(
)>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_QueryTexture( ... )>

Query the attributes of a texture.

	my ( $format, $access, $w, $h ) = SDL_QueryTexture( $texture );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<texture> - the texture to query

=back

Returns the following on success...

=over

=item C<format> - a pointer filled in with the raw format of the texture; the
actual format may differ, but pixel transfers will use this
format (one of the L<< C<:pixelFormatEnum>|/C<:pixelFormatEnum> >> values)

=item C<access> - a pointer filled in with the actual access to the texture (one of the L<< C<:textureAccess>|/C<:textureAccess> >> values)

=item C<w> - a pointer filled in with the width of the texture in pixels

=item C<h> - a pointer filled in with the height of the texture in pixels

more information.

=head2 C<SDL_SetTextureAlphaMod( ... )>

Set an additional alpha value multiplied into render copy operations.

	SDL_SetTextureAlphaMod( $texture, 100 );

When this texture is rendered, during the copy operation the source alpha

value is modulated by this alpha value according to the following formula:

	srcA = srcA * (alpha / 255)

Alpha modulation is not always supported by the renderer; it will return C<-1>
if alpha modulation is not supported.

Expected parameters include:

=head2 C<SDL_SetTextureBlendMode( ... )>

Set the blend mode for a texture, used by L<< C<SDL_RenderCopy( ...
)>|/C<SDL_RenderCopy( ... )> >>.

	my $rect = SDL2::Rect->new( { x => 0, y => ..., w => $surface->w, h => $surface->h } );
	SDL_UpdateTexture( $texture, $rect, $surface->pixels, $surface->pitch );

The pixel data must be in the pixel format of the texture. Use L<<
C<SDL_QueryTexture( ... )>|/C<SDL_QueryTexture( ... )> >> to query the pixel
format of the texture.

This is a fairly slow function, intended for use with static textures that do
not change often.

If the texture is intended to be updated often, it is preferred to create the
texture as streaming and use the locking functions referenced below. While this
function will work with streaming textures, for optimization reasons you may
not get the pixels back if you lock the texture afterward.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<texture> - the texture to update

=item C<rect> - an L<SDL2::Rect> structure representing the area to update, or undef to update the entire texture

Update a rectangle within a planar YV12 or IYUV texture with new pixel data.

	SDL_UpdateYUVTexture( $texture, $rect, $yPlane, $yPitch, $uPlane, $uPitch, $vPlane, $vPitch );

You can use L<< C<SDL_UpdateTexture( ... )>|/C<SDL_UpdateTexture( ... )> >> as
long as your pixel data is a contiguous block of Y and U/V planes in the proper
order, but this function is available if your pixel data is not contiguous.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<texture> - the texture to update

=item C<rect> - a pointer to the rectangle of pixels to update, or undef to update the entire texture

=item C<Yplane> - the raw pixel data for the Y plane

=item C<Ypitch> - the number of bytes between rows of pixel data for the Y plane

=head2 C<SDL_UpdateNVTexture( ... )>

Update a rectangle within a planar NV12 or NV21 texture with new pixels.

	SDL_UpdateNVTexture( $texture, $rect, $yPlane, $yPitch, $uPlane, $uPitch );

You can use L<< C<SDL_UpdateTexture( ... )>|/C<SDL_UpdateTexture( ... )> >> as
long as your pixel data is a contiguous block of NV12/21 planes in the proper
order, but this function is available if your pixel data is not contiguous.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<texture> - the texture to update

=item C<rect> - a pointer to the rectangle of pixels to update, or undef to update the entire texture.

=item C<Yplane> - the raw pixel data for the Y plane.

=item C<Ypitch> - the number of bytes between rows of pixel data for the Y plane.

=head2 C<SDL_LockTexture( ... )>

Lock a portion of the texture for B<write-only> pixel access.

	SDL_LockTexture( $texture, $rect, $pixels, $pitch );

As an optimization, the pixels made available for editing don't necessarily
contain the old texture data. This is a write-only operation, and if you need
to keep a copy of the texture data you should do that at the application level.

You must use L<< C<SDL_UpdateTexture( ... )>|/C<SDL_UpdateTexture( ... )> >> to
unlock the pixels and apply any changes.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<texture> - the texture to lock for access, which was created with C<SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING>

=item C<rect> - an L<SDL2::Rect> structure representing the area to lock for access; undef to lock the entire texture

=item C<pitch> - this is filled in with the pitch of the locked pixels; the pitch is the length of one row in bytes

=back

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code if the texture is not valid or
was not created with `SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING`; call L<< C<SDL_GetError(
)>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_LockTextureToSurface( ... )>

Lock a portion of the texture for B<write-only> pixel access, and expose it as
a SDL surface.

	my $surface = SDL_LockTextureSurface( $texture, $rect );

Besides providing an L<SDL2::Surface> instead of raw pixel data, this function
operates like L<SDL2::LockTexture>.

As an optimization, the pixels made available for editing don't necessarily
contain the old texture data. This is a write-only operation, and if you need
to keep a copy of the texture data you should do that at the application level.

You must use L<< C<SDL_UnlockTexture( ... )>|/C<SDL_UnlockTexture( ... )> >> to
unlock the pixels and apply any changes.

The returned surface is freed internally after calling L<< C<SDL_UnlockTexture(
... )>|/C<SDL_UnlockTexture( ... )> >> or L<< C<SDL_DestroyTexture( ...
)>|/C<SDL_DestroyTexture( ... )> >>. The caller should not free it.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<texture> - the texture to lock for access, which was created with C<SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING>

=item C<rect> - a pointer to the rectangle to lock for access. If the rect is undef, the entire texture will be locked

Returns the L<SDL2::Surface> structure on success, or C<-1> if the texture is
not valid or was not created with C<SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING>.

=head2 C<SDL_UnlockTexture( ... )>

Unlock a texture, uploading the changes to video memory, if needed.

	SDL_UnlockTexture( $texture );

B<Warning>: Please note that L<< C<SDL_LockTexture( ... )>|/C<SDL_LockTexture(
... )> >> is intended to be write-only; it will notguarantee the previous
contents of the texture will be provided. You must fully initialize any area of
a texture that you lock before unlocking it, as the pixels might otherwise be
uninitialized memory.

Which is to say: locking and immediately unlocking a texture can result in
corrupted textures, depending on the renderer in use.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<texture> - a texture locked by L<< C<SDL_LockTexture( ... )>|/C<SDL_LockTexture( ... )> >>

=back

=back

Returns true if supported or false if not.

=head2 C<SDL_SetRenderTarget( ... )>

Set a texture as the current rendering target.

	SDL_SetRenderTarget( $renderer, $texture );

Before using this function, you should check the C<SDL_RENDERER_TARGETTEXTURE>
bit in the flags of L<SDL2::RendererInfo> to see if render targets are
supported.

The default render target is the window for which the renderer was created. To
stop rendering to a texture and render to the window again, call this function
with a undefined C<texture>.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - the rendering context

=item C<texture> - the targeted texture, which must be created with the C<SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_TARGET> flag, or undef to render to the window instead of a texture.

=back

Returns the current render target or undef for the default render target.

=head2 C<SDL_RenderSetLogicalSize( ... )>

Set a device independent resolution for rendering.

	SDL_RenderSetLogicalSize( $renderer, 100, 100 );

This function uses the viewport and scaling functionality to allow a fixed
logical resolution for rendering, regardless of the actual output resolution.
If the actual output resolution doesn't have the same aspect ratio the output
rendering will be centered within the output display.

If the output display is a window, mouse and touch events in the window will be
filtered and scaled so they seem to arrive within the logical resolution.

If this function results in scaling or subpixel drawing by the rendering
backend, it will be handled using the appropriate quality hints.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - the renderer for which resolution should be set

=item C<w> - the width of the logical resolution

=item C<h> - the height of the logical resolution

=head2 C<SDL_RenderGetLogicalSize( ... )>

Get device independent resolution for rendering.

	my ($w, $h) = SDL_RenderGetLogicalSize( $renderer );

This may return C<0> for C<w> and C<h> if the L<SDL2::Renderer> has never had
its logical size set by L<< C<SDL_RenderSetLogicalSize( ...
)>|/C<SDL_RenderSetLogicalSize( ... )> >> and never had a render target set.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - a rendering context

=head2 C<SDL_RenderSetIntegerScale( ... )>

Set whether to force integer scales for resolution-independent rendering.

rounded down to the lower multiple.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - the renderer for which integer scaling should be set

=item C<enable> - enable or disable the integer scaling for rendering

=head2 C<SDL_RenderSetScale( ... )>

Set the drawing scale for rendering on the current target.

	SDL_RenderSetScale( $renderer, .5, 1 );

The drawing coordinates are scaled by the x/y scaling factors before they are
used by the renderer. This allows resolution independent drawing with a single
coordinate system.

If this results in scaling or subpixel drawing by the rendering backend, it
will be handled using the appropriate quality hints. For best results use
integer scaling factors.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - a rendering context

=item C<scaleX> - the horizontal scaling factor

        SDL_PIXELFORMAT_RGB888,
        $surface->pixels, $surface->pitch
    );

B<WARNING>: This is a very slow operation, and should not be used frequently.

C<pitch> specifies the number of bytes between rows in the destination
C<pixels> data. This allows you to write to a subrectangle or have padded rows
in the destination. Generally, C<pitch> should equal the number of pixels per
row in the `pixels` data times the number of bytes per pixel, but it might
contain additional padding (for example, 24bit RGB Windows Bitmap data pads all
rows to multiples of 4 bytes).

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - the rendering context

=item C<rect> - an L<SDL2::Rect> structure representing the area to read

=for TODO: or NULL for the entire render target

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_RenderPresent( ... )>

Update the screen with any rendering performed since the previous call.

	SDL_RenderPresent( $renderer );

SDL's rendering functions operate on a backbuffer; that is, calling a rendering
function such as L<< C<SDL_RenderDrawLine( ... )>|/C<SDL_RenderDrawLine( ... )>
>> does not directly put a line on the screen, but rather updates the
backbuffer. As such, you compose your entire scene and *present* the composed
backbuffer to the screen as a complete picture.

Therefore, when using SDL's rendering API, one does all drawing intended for
the frame, and then calls this function once per frame to present the final
drawing to the user.

The backbuffer should be considered invalidated after each present; do not
assume that previous contents will exist between frames. You are strongly
encouraged to call L<< C<SDL_RenderClear( ... )>|/C<SDL_RenderClear( ... )> >>
to initialize the backbuffer before starting each new frame's drawing, even if
you plan to overwrite every pixel.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - the rendering context

=back

=head2 C<SDL_DestroyTexture( ... )>

Destroy the specified texture.

	SDL_DestroyTexture( $texture );

Passing undef or an otherwise invalid texture will set the SDL error message to
"Invalid texture".

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<texture> - the texture to destroy

=back


=head2 C<SDL_DestroyRenderer( ... )>

Destroy the rendering context for a window and free associated textures.

	SDL_DestroyRenderer( $renderer );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - the rendering context

=back

=head2 C<SDL_RenderFlush( ... )>

Force the rendering context to flush any pending commands to the underlying
rendering API.

	SDL_RenderFlush( $renderer );

You do not need to (and in fact, shouldn't) call this function unless you are
planning to call into OpenGL/Direct3D/Metal/whatever directly in addition to
using an SDL_Renderer.

This is for a very-specific case: if you are using SDL's render API, you asked
for a specific renderer backend (OpenGL, Direct3D, etc), you set
C<SDL_HINT_RENDER_BATCHING> to "C<1>", and you plan to make OpenGL/D3D/whatever
calls in addition to SDL render API calls. If all of this applies, you should
call L<< C<SDL_RenderFlush( ... )>|/C<SDL_RenderFlush( ... )> >> between calls
to SDL's render API and the low-level API you're using in cooperation.

In all other cases, you can ignore this function. This is only here to get
maximum performance out of a specific situation. In all other cases, SDL will
do the right thing, perhaps at a performance loss.

This function is first available in SDL 2.0.10, and is not needed in 2.0.9 and
earlier, as earlier versions did not queue rendering commands at all, instead
flushing them to the OS immediately.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - the rendering context

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more information.


=head2 C<SDL_GL_BindTexture( ... )>

Bind an OpenGL/ES/ES2 texture to the current context.

	my ($texw, $texh) = SDL_GL_BindTexture( $texture );

This is for use with OpenGL instructions when rendering OpenGL primitives
directly.

If not NULL, the returned width and height values suitable for the provided
texture. In most cases, both will be C<1.0>, however, on systems that support
the GL_ARB_texture_rectangle extension, these values will actually be the pixel
width and height used to create the texture, so this factor needs to be taken
into account when providing texture coordinates to OpenGL.

You need a renderer to create an L<SDL2::Texture>, therefore you can only use
this function with an implicit OpenGL context from L<< C<SDL_CreateRenderer(
... )>|/C<SDL_CreateRenderer( ... )> >>, not with your own OpenGL context. If
you need control over your OpenGL context, you need to write your own
texture-loading methods.

Also note that SDL may upload RGB textures as BGR (or vice-versa), and re-order
the color channels in the shaders phase, so the uploaded texture may have
swapped color channels.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<texture> - the texture to bind to the current OpenGL/ES/ES2 context

=back

Returns the texture's with and height on success, or -1 if the operation is not
supported; call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>() for more
information.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_UnbindTexture( ... )>

Unbind an OpenGL/ES/ES2 texture from the current context.

	SDL_GL_UnbindTexture( $texture );

See L<< C<SDL_GL_BindTexture( ... )>|/C<SDL_GL_BindTexture( ... )> >> for
examples on how to use these functions.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<texture> - the texture to unbind from the current OpenGL/ES/ES2 context

=back

Returns C<0> on success, or C<-1> if the operation is not supported.

=head2 C<SDL_RenderGetMetalLayer( ... )>

Get the CAMetalLayer associated with the given Metal renderer.

	my $opaque = SDL_RenderGetMetalLayer( $renderer );

This function returns C<void *>, so SDL doesn't have to include Metal's
headers, but it can be safely cast to a C<CAMetalLayer *>.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - the renderer to query

=back
 
Returns C<CAMetalLayer*> on success, or undef if the renderer isn't a Metal
renderer.

=head2 C<SDL_RenderGetMetalCommandEncoder( ... )>

Get the Metal command encoder for the current frame

	$opaque = SDL_RenderGetMetalCommandEncoder( $renderer );

This function returns C<void *>, so SDL doesn't have to include Metal's
headers, but it can be safely cast to an
C<idE<lt>MTLRenderCommandEncoderE<gt>>.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - the renderer to query

=back

Returns C<idE<lt>MTLRenderCommandEncoderE<gt>> on success, or undef if the
renderer isn't a Metal renderer.





















































=head2 C<SDL_ComposeCustomBlendMode( ... )>

Compose a custom blend mode for renderers.

	

The functions SDL_SetRenderDrawBlendMode and SDL_SetTextureBlendMode accept the
SDL_BlendMode returned by this function if the renderer supports it.

A blend mode controls how the pixels from a drawing operation (source) get
combined with the pixels from the render target (destination). First, the
components of the source and destination pixels get multiplied with their blend
factors. Then, the blend operation takes the two products and calculates the
result that will get stored in the render target.

Expressed in pseudocode, it would look like this:

	my $dstRGB = colorOperation( $srcRGB * $srcColorFactor, $dstRGB * $dstColorFactor );
 	my $dstA   = alphaOperation( $srcA * $srcAlphaFactor, $dstA * $dstAlphaFactor );

Where the functions C<colorOperation(src, dst)> and C<alphaOperation(src, dst)>
can return one of the following:

=over

=item C<src + dst>

=item C<src - dst>

=item C<dst - src>

=item C<min(src, dst)>

=item C<max(src, dst)>

=back
 
The red, green, and blue components are always multiplied with the first,
second, and third components of the SDL_BlendFactor, respectively. The fourth
component is not used.

The alpha component is always multiplied with the fourth component of the L<<
C<:blendFactor>|/C<:blendFactor> >>. The other components are not used in the
alpha calculation.

Support for these blend modes varies for each renderer. To check if a specific
L<< C<:blendMode>|/C<:blendMode> >> is supported, create a renderer and pass it
to either C<SDL_SetRenderDrawBlendMode> or C<SDL_SetTextureBlendMode>. They
will return with an error if the blend mode is not supported.

This list describes the support of custom blend modes for each renderer in SDL
2.0.6. All renderers support the four blend modes listed in the L<<
C<:blendMode>|/C<:blendMode> >> enumeration.

=over

=item B<direct3d> - Supports C<SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD> with all factors.

=item B<direct3d11> - Supports all operations with all factors. However, some factors produce unexpected results with C<SDL_BLENDOPERATION_MINIMUM> and C<SDL_BLENDOPERATION_MAXIMUM>.

=item B<opengl> - Supports the C<SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD> operation with all factors. OpenGL versions 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 do not work correctly with SDL 2.0.6.

=item B<opengles> - Supports the C<SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD> operation with all factors. Color and alpha factors need to be the same. OpenGL ES 1 implementation specific: May also support C<SDL_BLENDOPERATION_SUBTRACT> and C<SDL_BLENDOPERATION_REV_SUBTRACT>. May support color and alpha operations being different from each other. May support color and alpha factors being different from each other.

=item B<opengles2> - Supports the C<SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD>, C<SDL_BLENDOPERATION_SUBTRACT>, C<SDL_BLENDOPERATION_REV_SUBTRACT> operations with all factors.

=item B<psp> - No custom blend mode support.

=item B<software> - No custom blend mode support.

=back

Some renderers do not provide an alpha component for the default render target.
The C<SDL_BLENDFACTOR_DST_ALPHA> and C<SDL_BLENDFACTOR_ONE_MINUS_DST_ALPHA>
factors do not have an effect in this case.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<srcColorFactor> -the C<:blendFactor> applied to the red, green, and blue components of the source pixels

=item C<dstColorFactor> - the C<:blendFactor> applied to the red, green, and blue components of the destination pixels

=item C<colorOperation> - the C<:blendOperation> used to combine the red, green, and blue components of the source and destination pixels

=item C<srcAlphaFactor> - the C<:blendFactor> applied to the alpha component of the source pixels

=item C<dstAlphaFactor> - the C<:blendFactor> applied to the alpha component of the destination pixels

=item C<alphaOperation> - the C<:blendOperation> used to combine the alpha component of the source and destination pixels

=back

Returns a C<:blendMode> that represents the chosen factors and operations.
















































































































 













































































































 


















=head1 Imports

This list of imports will be organized by their related tags. Of course, you
may import them all by name as well.

=head2 C<:init>

These are the flags which may be passed to C<SDL_Init()>. You should specify
the subsystems which you will be using in your application.

=over

=back

=head2 C<:hints>

=over

=item C<SDL_HINT_DEFAULT> - low priority, used for default values

=item C<SDL_HINT_NORMAL> - medium priority

=item C<SDL_HINT_OVERRIDE> - high priority

=back

=head2 SDL_Hint

These enum values can be passed to L<Configuration Variable|SDL2/Configuration
Variables> related functions.

=over

=item C<SDL_HINT_ACCELEROMETER_AS_JOYSTICK>

A hint that specifies whether the Android / iOS built-in accelerometer should
be listed as a joystick device, rather than listing actual joysticks only.

Values:

    0   list only real joysticks and accept input from them
    1   list real joysticks along with the accelorometer as if it were a 3 axis joystick (the default)

Example:

    # This disables the use of gyroscopes as axis device
    SDL_SetHint(SDL_HINT_ACCELEROMETER_AS_JOYSTICK, "0");

=item C<SDL_HINT_ANDROID_APK_EXPANSION_MAIN_FILE_VERSION>

A hint that specifies the Android APK expansion main file version.

Values:

    X   the Android APK expansion main file version (should be a string number like "1", "2" etc.)

This hint must be set together with the hint
C<SDL_HINT_ANDROID_APK_EXPANSION_PATCH_FILE_VERSION>.

If both hints were set then C<SDL_RWFromFile()> will look into expansion files
after a given relative path was not found in the internal storage and assets.

By default this hint is not set and the APK expansion files are not searched.

=item C<SDL_HINT_ANDROID_APK_EXPANSION_PATCH_FILE_VERSION>

A hint that specifies the Android APK expansion patch file version.

Values:

    X   the Android APK expansion patch file version (should be a string number like "1", "2" etc.)

This hint must be set together with the hint
C<SDL_HINT_ANDROID_APK_EXPANSION_MAIN_FILE_VERSION>.

If both hints were set then C<SDL_RWFromFile()> will look into expansion files
after a given relative path was not found in the internal storage and assets.

By default this hint is not set and the APK expansion files are not searched.

=item C<SDL_HINT_ANDROID_SEPARATE_MOUSE_AND_TOUCH>

A hint that specifies a variable to control whether mouse and touch events are
to be treated together or separately.

Values:

    0   mouse events will be handled as touch events and touch will raise fake mouse events (default)
    1   mouse events will be handled separately from pure touch events

By default mouse events will be handled as touch events and touch will raise
fake mouse events.

The value of this hint is used at runtime, so it can be changed at any time.

=item C<SDL_HINT_APPLE_TV_CONTROLLER_UI_EVENTS>

A hint that specifies whether controllers used with the Apple TV generate UI
events.

Values:

    0   controller input does not gnerate UI events (default)
    1   controller input generates UI events

When UI events are generated by controller input, the app will be backgrounded
when the Apple TV remote's menu button is pressed, and when the pause or B
buttons on gamepads are pressed.

More information about properly making use of controllers for the Apple TV can
be found here:
https://developer.apple.com/tvos/human-interface-guidelines/remote-and-controllers/

=item C<SDL_HINT_APPLE_TV_REMOTE_ALLOW_ROTATION>

A hint that specifies whether the Apple TV remote's joystick axes will
automatically match the rotation of the remote.


Values:

    0   remote orientation does not affect joystick axes (default)
    1   joystick axes are based on the orientation of the remote

=item C<SDL_HINT_BMP_SAVE_LEGACY_FORMAT>

A hint that specifies whether SDL should not use version 4 of the bitmap header
when saving BMPs.

Values:

    0   version 4 of the bitmap header will be used when saving BMPs (default)
    1   version 4 of the bitmap header will not be used when saving BMPs

The bitmap header version 4 is required for proper alpha channel support and
SDL will use it when required. Should this not be desired, this hint can force
the use of the 40 byte header version which is supported everywhere.

If the hint is not set then surfaces with a colorkey or an alpha channel are
saved to a 32-bit BMP file with an alpha mask. SDL will use the bitmap header
version 4 and set the alpha mask accordingly. This is the default behavior
since SDL 2.0.5.

If the hint is set then surfaces with a colorkey or an alpha channel are saved
to a 32-bit BMP file without an alpha mask. The alpha channel data will be in
the file, but applications are going to ignore it. This was the default
behavior before SDL 2.0.5.

=item C<SDL_HINT_EMSCRIPTEN_ASYNCIFY>

A hint that specifies if SDL should give back control to the browser
automatically when running with asyncify.

Values:

    0   disable emscripten_sleep calls (if you give back browser control manually or use asyncify for other purposes)
    1   enable emscripten_sleep calls (default)

This hint only applies to the Emscripten platform.

=item C<SDL_HINT_EMSCRIPTEN_KEYBOARD_ELEMENT>

A hint that specifies a value to override the binding element for keyboard
inputs for Emscripten builds.

Values:

    #window     the JavaScript window object (default)
    #document   the JavaScript document object
    #screen     the JavaScript window.screen object
    #canvas     the default WebGL canvas element

Any other string without a leading # sign applies to the element on the page
with that ID.

This hint only applies to the Emscripten platform.

=item C<SDL_HINT_FRAMEBUFFER_ACCELERATION>

A hint that specifies how 3D acceleration is used with
L<SDL_GetWindowSurface()|SDL2/SDL_GetWindowSurface( ... )>.

Values:

    0   disable 3D acceleration
    1   enable 3D acceleration, using the default renderer
    X   enable 3D acceleration, using X where X is one of the valid rendering drivers. (e.g. "direct3d", "opengl", etc.)

By default SDL tries to make a best guess whether to use acceleration or not on
each platform.

SDL can try to accelerate the screen surface returned by
L<SDL_GetWindowSurface()|SDL2/SDL_GetWindowSurface( ... )> by using streaming
textures with a 3D rendering engine. This variable controls whether and how
this is done.

=item C<SDL_HINT_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG>

A variable that lets you provide a file with extra gamecontroller db entries.

This hint must be set before calling C<SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_GAMECONTROLLER)>.

You can update mappings after the system is initialized with
C<SDL_GameControllerMappingForGUID()> and C<SDL_GameControllerAddMapping()>.

=item C<SDL_HINT_GRAB_KEYBOARD>

A variable setting the double click time, in milliseconds.

=item C<SDL_HINT_IDLE_TIMER_DISABLED>

A hint that specifies a variable controlling whether the idle timer is disabled
on iOS.

Values:

    0   enable idle timer (default)
    1   disable idle timer

When an iOS application does not receive touches for some time, the screen is
dimmed automatically. For games where the accelerometer is the only input this
is problematic. This functionality can be disabled by setting this hint.

As of SDL 2.0.4, C<SDL_EnableScreenSaver()> and C<SDL_DisableScreenSaver()>
accomplish the same thing on iOS. They should be preferred over this hint.

=item C<SDL_HINT_IME_INTERNAL_EDITING>

A variable to control whether we trap the Android back button to handle it
manually. This is necessary for the right mouse button to work on some Android
devices, or to be able to trap the back button for use in your code reliably.
If set to true, the back button will show up as an C<SDL_KEYDOWN> /
C<SDL_KEYUP> pair with a keycode of C<SDL_SCANCODE_AC_BACK>.

The variable can be set to the following values:

    0   Back button will be handled as usual for system. (default)
    1   Back button will be trapped, allowing you to handle the key press
        manually. (This will also let right mouse click work on systems
        where the right mouse button functions as back.)

The value of this hint is used at runtime, so it can be changed at any time.

=item C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_ALLOW_BACKGROUND_EVENTS>

A variable controlling whether the HIDAPI joystick drivers should be used.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   HIDAPI drivers are not used
    1   HIDAPI drivers are used (default)

This variable is the default for all drivers, but can be overridden by the
hints for specific drivers below.

=item C<SDL_HINT_MAC_BACKGROUND_APP>

A hint that specifies if the SDL app should not be forced to become a
foreground process on Mac OS X.

Values:

    0   force the SDL app to become a foreground process (default)

Mac.

Values:

    0   disable emulating right click (default)
    1   enable emulating right click

=item C<SDL_HINT_MOUSE_FOCUS_CLICKTHROUGH>

A hint that specifies if mouse click events are sent when clicking to focus an
SDL window.

A hint that specifies not to catch the C<SIGINT> or C<SIGTERM> signals.

Values:

    0   SDL will install a SIGINT and SIGTERM handler, and when it
        catches a signal, convert it into an SDL_QUIT event
    1   SDL will not install a signal handler at all

=item C<SDL_HINT_ORIENTATIONS>

A variable controlling which orientations are allowed on iOS/Android.

In some circumstances it is necessary to be able to explicitly control which UI
orientations are allowed.

This variable is a space delimited list of the following values:

=over

=item C<LandscapeLeft>

=item C<LandscapeRight>

=item C<Portrait>

=item C<PortraitUpsideDown>

=back

=item C<SDL_HINT_RENDER_DIRECT3D11_DEBUG>

A variable controlling whether to enable Direct3D 11+'s Debug Layer.

This variable does not have any effect on the Direct3D 9 based renderer.

This variable can be set to the following values:

thread-safe operations.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   Thread-safety is not enabled (faster; default)
    1   Thread-safety is enabled

=item C<SDL_HINT_RENDER_DRIVER>

A variable specifying which render driver to use.

If the application doesn't pick a specific renderer to use, this variable
specifies the name of the preferred renderer. If the preferred renderer can't
be initialized, the normal default renderer is used.

This variable is case insensitive and can be set to the following values:

=over

=item C<direct3d>

=item C<opengl>

=item C<opengles2>

=item C<opengles>

=item C<metal>

=item C<software>

=back

The default varies by platform, but it's the first one in the list that is
available on the current platform.

=item C<SDL_HINT_RENDER_OPENGL_SHADERS>

A variable controlling whether the OpenGL render driver uses shaders if they
are available.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   Disable shaders
    1   Enable shaders (default)

=item C<SDL_HINT_RENDER_SCALE_QUALITY>

A variable controlling the scaling quality

This variable can be set to the following values:     0 or nearest    Nearest
pixel sampling (default)     1 or linear     Linear filtering (supported by
OpenGL and Direct3D)     2 or best       Currently this is the same as linear

=item C<SDL_HINT_RENDER_VSYNC>

A variable controlling whether updates to the SDL screen surface should be
synchronized with the vertical refresh, to avoid tearing.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   Disable vsync
    1   Enable vsync

By default SDL does not sync screen surface updates with vertical refresh.

=item C<SDL_HINT_RPI_VIDEO_LAYER>

Tell SDL which Dispmanx layer to use on a Raspberry PI

Also known as Z-order. The variable can take a negative or positive value.

The default is C<10000>.

=item C<SDL_HINT_THREAD_STACK_SIZE>

A string specifying SDL's threads stack size in bytes or C<0> for the backend's
default size

Use this hint in case you need to set SDL's threads stack size to other than
the default. This is specially useful if you build SDL against a non glibc libc
library (such as musl) which provides a relatively small default thread stack
size (a few kilobytes versus the default 8MB glibc uses). Support for this hint
is currently available only in the pthread, Windows, and PSP backend.

Instead of this hint, in 2.0.9 and later, you can use
C<SDL_CreateThreadWithStackSize()>. This hint only works with the classic
C<SDL_CreateThread()>.

=item C<SDL_HINT_TIMER_RESOLUTION>

A variable that controls the timer resolution, in milliseconds.

he higher resolution the timer, the more frequently the CPU services timer
interrupts, and the more precise delays are, but this takes up power and CPU
time.  This hint is only used on Windows.

See this blog post for more information:
L<http://randomascii.wordpress.com/2013/07/08/windows-timer-resolution-megawatts-wasted/>

If this variable is set to C<0>, the system timer resolution is not set.

The default value is C<1>. This hint may be set at any time.

=item C<SDL_HINT_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER>

A variable controlling whether the screensaver is enabled.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   Disable screensaver
    1   Enable screensaver

By default SDL will disable the screensaver.

=item C<SDL_HINT_VIDEO_HIGHDPI_DISABLED>

If set to C<1>, then do not allow high-DPI windows. ("Retina" on Mac and iOS)

=item C<SDL_HINT_VIDEO_MAC_FULLSCREEN_SPACES>

A variable that dictates policy for fullscreen Spaces on Mac OS X.

This hint only applies to Mac OS X.

The variable can be set to the following values:

    0   Disable Spaces support (FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP won't use them and
        SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE windows won't offer the "fullscreen"
        button on their titlebars).
    1   Enable Spaces support (FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP will use them and
        SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE windows will offer the "fullscreen"
        button on their titlebars).

The default value is C<1>. Spaces are disabled regardless of this hint if the
OS isn't at least Mac OS X Lion (10.7). This hint must be set before any
windows are created.

=item C<SDL_HINT_VIDEO_MINIMIZE_ON_FOCUS_LOSS>

Minimize your C<SDL_Window> if it loses key focus when in fullscreen mode.
Defaults to false.

Warning: Before SDL 2.0.14, this defaulted to true! In 2.0.14, we're seeing if
"true" causes more problems than it solves in modern times.

=item C<SDL_HINT_VIDEO_WIN_D3DCOMPILER>

A variable specifying which shader compiler to preload when using the Chrome
ANGLE binaries

SDL has EGL and OpenGL ES2 support on Windows via the ANGLE project. It can use
two different sets of binaries, those compiled by the user from source or those
provided by the Chrome browser. In the later case, these binaries require that
SDL loads a DLL providing the shader compiler.

This variable can be set to the following values:

=over

=item C<d3dcompiler_46.dll>

default, best for Vista or later.

=item C<d3dcompiler_43.dll>

for XP support.

=item C<none>

do not load any library, useful if you compiled ANGLE from source and included
the compiler in your binaries.

=back

=item C<SDL_HINT_VIDEO_WINDOW_SHARE_PIXEL_FORMAT>

A variable that is the address of another C<SDL_Window*> (as a hex string
formatted with C<%p>).

If this hint is set before C<SDL_CreateWindowFrom()> and the C<SDL_Window*> it
is set to has C<SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL> set (and running on WGL only, currently),
then two things will occur on the newly created C<SDL_Window>:

=over

=item 1. Its pixel format will be set to the same pixel format as this C<SDL_Window>. This is needed for example when sharing an OpenGL context across multiple windows.

=item 2. The flag SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL will be set on the new window so it can be used for OpenGL rendering.

=back

This variable can be set to the address (as a string C<%p>) of the
C<SDL_Window*> that new windows created with C<SDL_CreateWindowFrom()> should
share a pixel format with.

=item C<SDL_HINT_VIDEO_X11_NET_WM_PING>

A variable controlling whether the X11 _NET_WM_PING protocol should be
supported.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0    Disable _NET_WM_PING
    1   Enable _NET_WM_PING

By default SDL will use _NET_WM_PING, but for applications that know they will
not always be able to respond to ping requests in a timely manner they can turn
it off to avoid the window manager thinking the app is hung. The hint is
checked in CreateWindow.

=item C<SDL_HINT_VIDEO_X11_XINERAMA>

A variable controlling whether the X11 Xinerama extension should be used.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   Disable Xinerama
    1   Enable Xinerama

By default SDL will use Xinerama if it is available.

=item C<SDL_HINT_VIDEO_X11_XRANDR>

A variable controlling whether the X11 XRandR extension should be used.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   Disable XRandR
    1   Enable XRandR

By default SDL will not use XRandR because of window manager issues.

=item C<SDL_HINT_VIDEO_X11_XVIDMODE>

A variable controlling whether the X11 VidMode extension should be used.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   Disable XVidMode
    1   Enable XVidMode

By default SDL will use XVidMode if it is available.

=item C<SDL_HINT_WINDOW_FRAME_USABLE_WHILE_CURSOR_HIDDEN>

A variable controlling whether the window frame and title bar are interactive
when the cursor is hidden.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   The window frame is not interactive when the cursor is hidden (no move, resize, etc)
    1   The window frame is interactive when the cursor is hidden

By default SDL will allow interaction with the window frame when the cursor is
hidden.

=item C<SDL_HINT_WINDOWS_DISABLE_THREAD_NAMING>

Tell SDL not to name threads on Windows with the 0x406D1388 Exception. The
0x406D1388 Exception is a trick used to inform Visual Studio of a thread's
name, but it tends to cause problems with other debuggers, and the .NET
runtime. Note that SDL 2.0.6 and later will still use the (safer)
SetThreadDescription API, introduced in the Windows 10 Creators Update, if
available.

The variable can be set to the following values:

    0   SDL will raise the 0x406D1388 Exception to name threads.
        This is the default behavior of SDL <= 2.0.4.
    1   SDL will not raise this exception, and threads will be unnamed. (default)
        This is necessary with .NET languages or debuggers that aren't Visual Studio.

=item C<SDL_HINT_WINDOWS_INTRESOURCE_ICON>

A variable to specify custom icon resource id from RC file on Windows platform.

=item C<SDL_HINT_WINDOWS_INTRESOURCE_ICON_SMALL>

A variable to specify custom icon resource id from RC file on Windows platform.

=item C<SDL_HINT_WINDOWS_ENABLE_MESSAGELOOP>

A variable controlling whether the windows message loop is processed by SDL .

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   The window message loop is not run
    1   The window message loop is processed in SDL_PumpEvents()

By default SDL will process the windows message loop.

=item C<SDL_HINT_WINDOWS_NO_CLOSE_ON_ALT_F4>

Tell SDL not to generate window-close events for Alt+F4 on Windows.

The variable can be set to the following values:

    0   SDL will generate a window-close event when it sees Alt+F4.
    1   SDL will only do normal key handling for Alt+F4.

=item C<SDL_HINT_WINRT_HANDLE_BACK_BUTTON>

Allows back-button-press events on Windows Phone to be marked as handled.

Windows Phone devices typically feature a Back button.  When pressed, the OS
will emit back-button-press events, which apps are expected to handle in an
appropriate manner.  If apps do not explicitly mark these events as 'Handled',
then the OS will invoke its default behavior for unhandled back-button-press
events, which on Windows Phone 8 and 8.1 is to terminate the app (and attempt
to switch to the previous app, or to the device's home screen).

Setting the C<SDL_HINT_WINRT_HANDLE_BACK_BUTTON> hint to "1" will cause SDL to
mark back-button-press events as Handled, if and when one is sent to the app.

Internally, Windows Phone sends back button events as parameters to special
back-button-press callback functions.  Apps that need to respond to
back-button-press events are expected to register one or more callback
functions for such, shortly after being launched (during the app's
initialization phase).  After the back button is pressed, the OS will invoke
these callbacks.  If the app's callback(s) do not explicitly mark the event as
handled by the time they return, or if the app never registers one of these
callback, the OS will consider the event un-handled, and it will apply its
default back button behavior (terminate the app).

SDL registers its own back-button-press callback with the Windows Phone OS.
This callback will emit a pair of SDL key-press events (C<SDL_KEYDOWN> and
C<SDL_KEYUP>), each with a scancode of SDL_SCANCODE_AC_BACK, after which it
will check the contents of the hint, C<SDL_HINT_WINRT_HANDLE_BACK_BUTTON>. If
the hint's value is set to C<1>, the back button event's Handled property will
get set to a C<true> value. If the hint's value is set to something else, or if
it is unset, SDL will leave the event's Handled property alone. (By default,
the OS sets this property to 'false', to note.)

SDL apps can either set C<SDL_HINT_WINRT_HANDLE_BACK_BUTTON> well before a back
button is pressed, or can set it in direct-response to a back button being
pressed.

In order to get notified when a back button is pressed, SDL apps should
register a callback function with C<SDL_AddEventWatch()>, and have it listen
for C<SDL_KEYDOWN> events that have a scancode of C<SDL_SCANCODE_AC_BACK>.
(Alternatively, C<SDL_KEYUP> events can be listened-for. Listening for either
event type is suitable.)  Any value of C<SDL_HINT_WINRT_HANDLE_BACK_BUTTON> set
by such a callback, will be applied to the OS' current back-button-press event.

More details on back button behavior in Windows Phone apps can be found at the
following page, on Microsoft's developer site:
L<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/jj247550(v=vs.105).aspx>

=item C<SDL_HINT_WINRT_PRIVACY_POLICY_LABEL>

Label text for a WinRT app's privacy policy link.

Network-enabled WinRT apps must include a privacy policy. On Windows 8, 8.1,
and RT, Microsoft mandates that this policy be available via the Windows
Settings charm. SDL provides code to add a link there, with its label text
being set via the optional hint, C<SDL_HINT_WINRT_PRIVACY_POLICY_LABEL>.

Please note that a privacy policy's contents are not set via this hint.  A
separate hint, C<SDL_HINT_WINRT_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL>, is used to link to the
actual text of the policy.

The contents of this hint should be encoded as a UTF8 string.

The default value is "Privacy Policy". This hint should only be set during app
initialization, preferably before any calls to C<SDL_Init()>.

For additional information on linking to a privacy policy, see the
documentation for C<SDL_HINT_WINRT_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL>.

=item C<SDL_HINT_WINRT_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL>

A URL to a WinRT app's privacy policy.

All network-enabled WinRT apps must make a privacy policy available to its
users.  On Windows 8, 8.1, and RT, Microsoft mandates that this policy be be
available in the Windows Settings charm, as accessed from within the app. SDL
provides code to add a URL-based link there, which can point to the app's
privacy policy.

To setup a URL to an app's privacy policy, set
C<SDL_HINT_WINRT_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL> before calling any C<SDL_Init()>
functions.  The contents of the hint should be a valid URL.  For example,
L<http://www.example.com>.

The default value is an empty string (C<>), which will prevent SDL from adding
a privacy policy link to the Settings charm. This hint should only be set
during app init.

The label text of an app's "Privacy Policy" link may be customized via another
hint, C<SDL_HINT_WINRT_PRIVACY_POLICY_LABEL>.

Please note that on Windows Phone, Microsoft does not provide standard UI for
displaying a privacy policy link, and as such,
SDL_HINT_WINRT_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL will not get used on that platform.
Network-enabled phone apps should display their privacy policy through some
other, in-app means.

=item C<SDL_HINT_XINPUT_ENABLED>

A variable that lets you disable the detection and use of Xinput gamepad
devices

The variable can be set to the following values:

    0   Disable XInput detection (only uses direct input)
    1   Enable XInput detection (default)

=item C<SDL_HINT_XINPUT_USE_OLD_JOYSTICK_MAPPING>

A variable that causes SDL to use the old axis and button mapping for XInput
devices.

This hint is for backwards compatibility only and will be removed in SDL 2.1

The default value is C<0>.  This hint must be set before C<SDL_Init()>

=item C<SDL_HINT_QTWAYLAND_WINDOW_FLAGS>

Flags to set on QtWayland windows to integrate with the native window manager.

On QtWayland platforms, this hint controls the flags to set on the windows. For
example, on Sailfish OS, C<OverridesSystemGestures> disables swipe gestures.

This variable is a space-separated list of the following values (empty = no
flags):

=over

=item C<OverridesSystemGestures>

=item C<StaysOnTop>

=item C<BypassWindowManager>

=back

=item C<SDL_HINT_QTWAYLAND_CONTENT_ORIENTATION>

A variable describing the content orientation on QtWayland-based platforms.

On QtWayland platforms, windows are rotated client-side to allow for custom
transitions. In order to correctly position overlays (e.g. volume bar) and
gestures (e.g. events view, close/minimize gestures), the system needs to know
in which orientation the application is currently drawing its contents.

This does not cause the window to be rotated or resized, the application needs
to take care of drawing the content in the right orientation (the framebuffer
is always in portrait mode).

This variable can be one of the following values:

=over

=item C<primary> (default)

=item C<portrait>

=item C<landscape>

=item C<inverted-portrait>

=item C<inverted-landscape>

=back

=item C<SDL_HINT_RENDER_LOGICAL_SIZE_MODE>

A variable controlling the scaling policy for C<SDL_RenderSetLogicalSize>.

This variable can be set to the following values:

=over

=item C<0> or C<letterbox>

Uses letterbox/sidebars to fit the entire rendering on screen.

=item C<1> or C<overscan>

Will zoom the rendering so it fills the entire screen, allowing edges to be
drawn offscreen.

=back

By default letterbox is used.

=item C<SDL_HINT_VIDEO_EXTERNAL_CONTEXT>

A variable controlling whether the graphics context is externally managed.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   SDL will manage graphics contexts that are attached to windows.
    1   Disable graphics context management on windows.

By default SDL will manage OpenGL contexts in certain situations. For example,
on Android the context will be automatically saved and restored when pausing
the application. Additionally, some platforms will assume usage of OpenGL if
Vulkan isn't used. Setting this to C<1> will prevent this behavior, which is
desireable when the application manages the graphics context, such as an
externally managed OpenGL context or attaching a Vulkan surface to the window.

=item <SDL_HINT_VIDEO_X11_WINDOW_VISUALID>

A variable forcing the visual ID chosen for new X11 windows.

=item C<SDL_HINT_VIDEO_X11_NET_WM_BYPASS_COMPOSITOR>

A variable controlling whether the X11 _NET_WM_BYPASS_COMPOSITOR hint should be
used.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   Disable _NET_WM_BYPASS_COMPOSITOR
    1   Enable _NET_WM_BYPASS_COMPOSITOR

By default SDL will use _NET_WM_BYPASS_COMPOSITOR.

=item C<SDL_HINT_VIDEO_X11_FORCE_EGL>

A variable controlling whether X11 should use GLX or EGL by default

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   Use GLX
    1   Use EGL

By default SDL will use GLX when both are present.

=item C<SDL_HINT_MOUSE_DOUBLE_CLICK_TIME>

A variable setting the double click time, in milliseconds.

=item C<SDL_HINT_MOUSE_DOUBLE_CLICK_RADIUS>

A variable setting the double click radius, in pixels.

=item C<SDL_HINT_MOUSE_NORMAL_SPEED_SCALE>

A variable setting the speed scale for mouse motion, in floating point, when
the mouse is not in relative mode.

=item C<SDL_HINT_MOUSE_RELATIVE_SPEED_SCALE>

A variable setting the scale for mouse motion, in floating point, when the
mouse is in relative mode.

=item C<SDL_HINT_MOUSE_RELATIVE_SCALING>

A variable controlling whether relative mouse motion is affected by renderer
scaling

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   Relative motion is unaffected by DPI or renderer's logical size
    1   Relative motion is scaled according to DPI scaling and logical size

By default relative mouse deltas are affected by DPI and renderer scaling.

=item C<SDL_HINT_TOUCH_MOUSE_EVENTS>

A variable controlling whether touch events should generate synthetic mouse
events

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   Touch events will not generate mouse events
    1   Touch events will generate mouse events

By default SDL will generate mouse events for touch events.

=item C<SDL_HINT_MOUSE_TOUCH_EVENTS>

A variable controlling whether mouse events should generate synthetic touch
events

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   Mouse events will not generate touch events (default for desktop platforms)
    1   Mouse events will generate touch events (default for mobile platforms, such as Android and iOS)

=item C<SDL_HINT_IOS_HIDE_HOME_INDICATOR>

A variable controlling whether the home indicator bar on iPhone X should be
hidden.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   The indicator bar is not hidden (default for windowed applications)
    1   The indicator bar is hidden and is shown when the screen is touched (useful for movie playback applications)
    2   The indicator bar is dim and the first swipe makes it visible and the second swipe performs the "home" action (default for fullscreen applications)

=item C<SDL_HINT_TV_REMOTE_AS_JOYSTICK>

A variable controlling whether the Android / tvOS remotes should be listed as
joystick devices, instead of sending keyboard events.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   Remotes send enter/escape/arrow key events
    1   Remotes are available as 2 axis, 2 button joysticks (the default).

=item C<SDL_HINT_GAMECONTROLLERTYPE>

A variable that overrides the automatic controller type detection

The variable should be comma separated entries, in the form: VID/PID=type

The VID and PID should be hexadecimal with exactly 4 digits, e.g. C<0x00fd>

The type should be one of:

=over

=item C<Xbox360>

=item C<XboxOne>

=item C<PS3>

=item C<PS4>

=item C<PS5>

=item C<SwitchPro>

This hint affects what driver is used, and must be set before calling
C<SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_GAMECONTROLLER)>.

=item C<SDL_HINT_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG_FILE>

A variable that lets you provide a file with extra gamecontroller db entries.

The file should contain lines of gamecontroller config data, see
SDL_gamecontroller.h

This hint must be set before calling C<SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_GAMECONTROLLER)>

You can update mappings after the system is initialized with
C<SDL_GameControllerMappingForGUID()> and C<SDL_GameControllerAddMapping()>.

=item C<SDL_HINT_GAMECONTROLLER_IGNORE_DEVICES>

A variable containing a list of devices to skip when scanning for game
controllers.

The format of the string is a comma separated list of USB VID/PID pairs in
hexadecimal form, e.g.

    0xAAAA/0xBBBB,0xCCCC/0xDDDD

The variable can also take the form of @file, in which case the named file will
be loaded and interpreted as the value of the variable.

=item C<SDL_HINT_GAMECONTROLLER_IGNORE_DEVICES_EXCEPT>

If set, all devices will be skipped when scanning for game controllers except
for the ones listed in this variable.

The format of the string is a comma separated list of USB VID/PID pairs in
hexadecimal form, e.g.

    0xAAAA/0xBBBB,0xCCCC/0xDDDD

The variable can also take the form of @file, in which case the named file will
be loaded and interpreted as the value of the variable.

=item C<SDL_HINT_GAMECONTROLLER_USE_BUTTON_LABELS>

If set, game controller face buttons report their values according to their
labels instead of their positional layout.

For example, on Nintendo Switch controllers, normally you'd get:

        (Y)
    (X)     (B)
        (A)

but if this hint is set, you'll get:

        (X)
    (Y)     (A)
        (B)

The variable can be set to the following values:

    0   Report the face buttons by position, as though they were on an Xbox controller.
    1   Report the face buttons by label instead of position

The default value is C<1>. This hint may be set at any time.

=item C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI>

A variable controlling whether the HIDAPI joystick drivers should be used.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   HIDAPI drivers are not used
    1   HIDAPI drivers are used (the default)

This variable is the default forall drivers, but can be overridden by the hints
for specific drivers below.\

=item C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI_PS4>

A variable controlling whether the HIDAPI driver for PS4 controllers should be
used.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   HIDAPI driver is not used
    1   HIDAPI driver is used

The default is the value of C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI>

=item C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI_PS4_RUMBLE>

A variable controlling whether extended input reports should be used for PS4
controllers when using the HIDAPI driver.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   extended reports are not enabled (default)
    1   extended reports

Extended input reports allow rumble on Bluetooth PS4 controllers, but break
DirectInput handling for applications that don't use SDL.

Once extended reports are enabled, they can not be disabled without power
cycling the controller.

For compatibility with applications written for versions of SDL prior to the
introduction of PS5 controller support, this value will also control the state
of extended reports on PS5 controllers when the
C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI_PS5_RUMBLE> hint is not explicitly set.

=item C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI_PS5>

A variable controlling whether the HIDAPI driver for PS5 controllers should be
used.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   HIDAPI driver is not used
    1   HIDAPI driver is used

The default is the value of C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI>.

=item C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI_PS5_RUMBLE>

A variable controlling whether extended input reports should be used for PS5
controllers when using the HIDAPI driver.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   extended reports are not enabled (default)
    1   extended reports

Extended input reports allow rumble on Bluetooth PS5 controllers, but break
DirectInput handling for applications that don't use SDL.

Once extended reports are enabled, they can not be disabled without power
cycling the controller.

For compatibility with applications written for versions of SDL prior to the
introduction of PS5 controller support, this value defaults to the value of
C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI_PS4_RUMBLE>.

=item C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI_PS5_PLAYER_LED>

A variable controlling whether the player LEDs should be lit to indicate which
player is associated with a PS5 controller.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   player LEDs are not enabled
    1   player LEDs are enabled (default)

=item C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI_STADIA>

A variable controlling whether the HIDAPI driver for Google Stadia controllers
should be used.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   HIDAPI driver is not used
    1   HIDAPI driver is used

The default is the value of C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI>.

=item C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI_STEAM>

A variable controlling whether the HIDAPI driver for Steam Controllers should
be used.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   HIDAPI driver is not used
    1   HIDAPI driver is used

The default is the value of C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI>.

=item C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI_SWITCH>

A variable controlling whether the HIDAPI driver for Nintendo Switch
controllers should be used.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   HIDAPI driver is not used
    1   HIDAPI driver is used

The default is the value of C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI>.

=item C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI_SWITCH_HOME_LED>

A variable controlling whether the Home button LED should be turned on when a
Nintendo Switch controller is opened

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   home button LED is left off
    1   home button LED is turned on (default)

=item C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI_JOY_CONS>

A variable controlling whether Switch Joy-Cons should be treated the same as
Switch Pro Controllers when using the HIDAPI driver.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   basic Joy-Con support with no analog input (default)
    1   Joy-Cons treated as half full Pro Controllers with analog inputs and sensors

This does not combine Joy-Cons into a single controller. That's up to the user.

=item C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI_XBOX>

A variable controlling whether the HIDAPI driver for XBox controllers should be
used.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   HIDAPI driver is not used
    1   HIDAPI driver is used

The default is C<0> on Windows, otherwise the value of
C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI>.

=item C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI_CORRELATE_XINPUT>

A variable controlling whether the HIDAPI driver for XBox controllers on
Windows should pull correlated data from XInput.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   HIDAPI Xbox driver will only use HIDAPI data
    1   HIDAPI Xbox driver will also pull data from XInput, providing better trigger axes, guide button
        presses, and rumble support

The default is C<1>.  This hint applies to any joysticks opened after setting
the hint.

=item C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI_GAMECUBE>

A variable controlling whether the HIDAPI driver for Nintendo GameCube
controllers should be used.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   HIDAPI driver is not used
    1   HIDAPI driver is used

The default is the value of C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_HIDAPI>.

=item C<SDL_HINT_ENABLE_STEAM_CONTROLLERS>

A variable that controls whether Steam Controllers should be exposed using the
SDL joystick and game controller APIs

The variable can be set to the following values:

    0   Do not scan for Steam Controllers
    1   Scan for Steam Controllers (default)

The default value is C<1>.  This hint must be set before initializing the
joystick subsystem.

=item C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_RAWINPUT>

A variable controlling whether the RAWINPUT joystick drivers should be used for
better handling XInput-capable devices.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   RAWINPUT drivers are not used
    1   RAWINPUT drivers are used (default)

=item C<SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_THREAD>

A variable controlling whether a separate thread should be used for handling
joystick detection and raw input messages on Windows

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   A separate thread is not used (default)
    1   A separate thread is used for handling raw input messages

=item C<SDL_HINT_LINUX_JOYSTICK_DEADZONES>

A variable controlling whether joysticks on Linux adhere to their HID-defined
deadzones or return unfiltered values.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   Return unfiltered joystick axis values (default)
    1   Return axis values with deadzones taken into account

=item C<SDL_HINT_ALLOW_TOPMOST>

If set to C<0> then never set the top most bit on a SDL Window, even if the
video mode expects it. This is a debugging aid for developers and not expected
to be used by end users. The default is C<1>.

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   don't allow topmost
    1   allow topmost (default)

=item C<SDL_HINT_THREAD_PRIORITY_POLICY>

A string specifying additional information to use with
C<SDL_SetThreadPriority>.

By default C<SDL_SetThreadPriority> will make appropriate system changes in
order to apply a thread priority. For example on systems using pthreads the
scheduler policy is changed automatically to a policy that works well with a
given priority. Code which has specific requirements can override SDL's default
behavior with this hint.

pthread hint values are C<current>, C<other>, C<fifo> and C<rr>. Currently no
other platform hint values are defined but may be in the future.

Note:

On Linux, the kernel may send C<SIGKILL> to realtime tasks which exceed the
distro configured execution budget for rtkit. This budget can be queried
through C<RLIMIT_RTTIME> after calling C<SDL_SetThreadPriority()>.

=item C<SDL_HINT_THREAD_FORCE_REALTIME_TIME_CRITICAL>

Specifies whether C<SDL_THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL> should be treated as
realtime.

On some platforms, like Linux, a realtime priority thread may be subject to
restrictions that require special handling by the application. This hint exists
to let SDL know that the app is prepared to handle said restrictions.

On Linux, SDL will apply the following configuration to any thread that becomes
realtime:

=over

=item * The SCHED_RESET_ON_FORK bit will be set on the scheduling policy,

=item * An RLIMIT_RTTIME budget will be configured to the rtkit specified limit.

Exceeding this limit will result in the kernel sending C<SIGKILL> to the app,

Refer to the man pages for more information.

=back

This variable can be set to the following values:

    0   default platform specific behaviour
    1   Force SDL_THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL to a realtime scheduling policy

=item C<SDL_HINT_VIDEO_WINDOW_SHARE_PIXEL_FORMAT>

A variable that is the address of another SDL_Window* (as a hex string
formatted with C<%p>).

If this hint is set before C<SDL_CreateWindowFrom()> and the C<SDL_Window*> it
is set to has C<SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL> set (and running on WGL only, currently),
then two things will occur on the newly created C<SDL_Window>:

=over

=item 1. Its pixel format will be set to the same pixel format as this C<SDL_Window>. This is needed for example when sharing an OpenGL context across multiple windows.

=item 2. The flag C<SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL> will be set on the new window so it can be used for OpenGL rendering.

This variable can be set to the following values:

=over

=item The address (as a string C<%p>) of the C<SDL_Window*> that new windows created with C<SDL_CreateWindowFrom()> should share a pixel format with.

=back

=item C<SDL_HINT_ANDROID_TRAP_BACK_BUTTON>

A variable to control whether we trap the Android back button to handle it
manually. This is necessary for the right mouse button to work on some Android
devices, or to be able to trap the back button for use in your code reliably.
If set to true, the back button will show up as an SDL_KEYDOWN / SDL_KEYUP pair
with a keycode of C<SDL_SCANCODE_AC_BACK>.

The variable can be set to the following values:

=over

=item C<0>

Back button will be handled as usual for system. (default)

=item C<1>

Back button will be trapped, allowing you to handle the key press manually.
(This will also let right mouse click work on systems where the right mouse
button functions as back.)

=back

The value of this hint is used at runtime, so it can be changed at any time.

=back

=item C<SDL_HINT_ANDROID_BLOCK_ON_PAUSE>

A variable to control whether the event loop will block itself when the app is
paused.

The variable can be set to the following values:

=over

=item C<0>

Non blocking.

=item C<1>

Blocking. (default)

=back

The value should be set before SDL is initialized.

=back

=item C<SDL_HINT_ANDROID_BLOCK_ON_PAUSE_PAUSEAUDIO>

A variable to control whether SDL will pause audio in background (Requires
C<SDL_ANDROID_BLOCK_ON_PAUSE> as "Non blocking")

The variable can be set to the following values:

=over

=item C<0>

Non paused.


=item C<1>

Paused. (default)

=back

The value should be set before SDL is initialized.

=item C<SDL_HINT_RETURN_KEY_HIDES_IME>

A variable to control whether the return key on the soft keyboard should hide
the soft keyboard on Android and iOS.

The variable can be set to the following values:

=over

=item C<0>

The return key will be handled as a key event. This is the behaviour of SDL <=
2.0.3. (default)

=item C<1>

The return key will hide the keyboard.

=back

The value of this hint is used at runtime, so it can be changed at any time.

=item C<SDL_HINT_WINDOWS_FORCE_MUTEX_CRITICAL_SECTIONS>

Force SDL to use Critical Sections for mutexes on Windows. On Windows 7 and
newer, Slim Reader/Writer Locks are available. They offer better performance,
allocate no kernel resources and use less memory. SDL will fall back to
Critical Sections on older OS versions or if forced to by this hint.

This also affects Condition Variables. When SRW mutexes are used, SDL will use
Windows Condition Variables as well. Else, a generic SDL_cond implementation
will be used that works with all mutexes.

This variable can be set to the following values:

=over

=item C<0>

Use SRW Locks when available. If not, fall back to Critical Sections. (default)

=item C<1>

Force the use of Critical Sections in all cases.

=back

=item C<SDL_HINT_WINDOWS_FORCE_SEMAPHORE_KERNEL>

Force SDL to use Kernel Semaphores on Windows. Kernel Semaphores are
inter-process and require a context switch on every interaction. On Windows 8
and newer, the WaitOnAddress API is available. Using that and atomics to
implement semaphores increases performance. SDL will fall back to Kernel
Objects on older OS versions or if forced to by this hint.

This variable can be set to the following values:

=over

=item C<0>

Use Atomics and WaitOnAddress API when available. If not, fall back to Kernel
Objects. (default)

=item C<1>

Force the use of Kernel Objects in all cases.

=back

=item C<SDL_HINT_WINDOWS_USE_D3D9EX>

Use the D3D9Ex API introduced in Windows Vista, instead of normal D3D9.
Direct3D 9Ex contains changes to state management that can eliminate device
loss errors during scenarios like Alt+Tab or UAC prompts. D3D9Ex may require
some changes to your application to cope with the new behavior, so this is
disabled by default.

This hint must be set before initializing the video subsystem.

For more information on Direct3D 9Ex, see:

=over

=item L<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3darticles/graphics-apis-in-windows-vista#direct3d-9ex>

=item L<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3darticles/direct3d-9ex-improvements>

=back

This variable can be set to the following values:

=over

=item C<0>

Use the original Direct3D 9 API (default)

=item C<1>

Use the Direct3D 9Ex API on Vista and later (and fall back if D3D9Ex is
unavailable)

=back

=item C<SDL_HINT_VIDEO_DOUBLE_BUFFER>

Tell the video driver that we only want a double buffer.

By default, most lowlevel 2D APIs will use a triple buffer scheme that wastes
no CPU time on waiting for vsync after issuing a flip, but introduces a frame
of latency. On the other hand, using a double buffer scheme instead is
recommended for cases where low latency is an important factor because we save
a whole frame of latency. We do so by waiting for vsync immediately after
issuing a flip, usually just after eglSwapBuffers call in the backend's
*_SwapWindow function.

Since it's driver-specific, it's only supported where possible and implemented.
Currently supported the following drivers:

=over

=item KMSDRM (kmsdrm)

=item Raspberry Pi (raspberrypi)

=back

=item C<SDL_HINT_KMSDRM_REQUIRE_DRM_MASTER>

Determines whether SDL enforces that DRM master is required in order to
initialize the KMSDRM video backend.

The DRM subsystem has a concept of a "DRM master" which is a DRM client that
has the ability to set planes, set cursor, etc. When SDL is DRM master, it can
draw to the screen using the SDL rendering APIs. Without DRM master, SDL is
still able to process input and query attributes of attached displays, but it
cannot change display state or draw to the screen directly.

In some cases, it can be useful to have the KMSDRM backend even if it cannot be
used for rendering. An app may want to use SDL for input processing while using
another rendering API (such as an MMAL overlay on Raspberry Pi) or using its
own code to render to DRM overlays that SDL doesn't support.

This hint must be set before initializing the video subsystem.

This variable can be set to the following values:

=over

=item C<0>

SDL will allow usage of the KMSDRM backend without DRM master

=item C<1>

SDL Will require DRM master to use the KMSDRM backend (default)

=back

=item C<SDL_HINT_OPENGL_ES_DRIVER>

A variable controlling what driver to use for OpenGL ES contexts.

On some platforms, currently Windows and X11, OpenGL drivers may support
creating contexts with an OpenGL ES profile. By default SDL uses these
profiles, when available, otherwise it attempts to load an OpenGL ES library,
e.g. that provided by the ANGLE project. This variable controls whether SDL
follows this default behaviour or will always load an OpenGL ES library.

Circumstances where this is useful include

=over

=item - Testing an app with a particular OpenGL ES implementation, e.g ANGLE, or emulator, e.g. those from ARM, Imagination or Qualcomm.

=item Resolving OpenGL ES function addresses at link time by linking with the OpenGL ES library instead of querying them at run time with C<SDL_GL_GetProcAddress()>.

=back

Caution: for an application to work with the default behaviour across different
OpenGL drivers it must query the OpenGL ES function addresses at run time using
C<SDL_GL_GetProcAddress()>.

This variable is ignored on most platforms because OpenGL ES is native or not
supported.

This variable can be set to the following values:

=over

=item C<0>

Use ES profile of OpenGL, if available. (Default when not set.)

=item C<1>

Load OpenGL ES library using the default library names.

=back

=item C<SDL_HINT_AUDIO_RESAMPLING_MODE>

A variable controlling speed/quality tradeoff of audio resampling.

If available, SDL can use libsamplerate ( http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/ ) to
handle audio resampling. There are different resampling modes available that
produce different levels of quality, using more CPU.

If this hint isn't specified to a valid setting, or libsamplerate isn't
available, SDL will use the default, internal resampling algorithm.

Note that this is currently only applicable to resampling audio that is being
written to a device for playback or audio being read from a device for capture.
SDL_AudioCVT always uses the default resampler (although this might change for
SDL 2.1).

This hint is currently only checked at audio subsystem initialization.

This variable can be set to the following values:

=over

=item C<0> or C<default>

Use SDL's internal resampling (Default when not set - low quality, fast)

=item C<1> or C<fast>

Use fast, slightly higher quality resampling, if available

=item C<2> or C<medium>

Use medium quality resampling, if available

=item C<3> or C<best>

Use high quality resampling, if available

=back

=item C<SDL_HINT_AUDIO_CATEGORY>

A variable controlling the audio category on iOS and Mac OS X.

This variable can be set to the following values:

=over

=item C<ambient>

Use the AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient audio category, will be muted by the
phone mute switch (default)

=item C<playback>

Use the AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback category

=back

For more information, see Apple's documentation:
L<https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Audio/Conceptual/AudioSessionProgrammingGuide/AudioSessionCategoriesandModes/AudioSessionCategoriesandModes.html>

=item C<SDL_HINT_RENDER_BATCHING>

A variable controlling whether the 2D render API is compatible or efficient.

This variable can be set to the following values:

=over

=item C<0>

Don't use batching to make rendering more efficient.

=item C<1>

Use batching, but might cause problems if app makes its own direct OpenGL
calls.

=back

Up to SDL 2.0.9, the render API would draw immediately when requested. Now it
batches up draw requests and sends them all to the GPU only when forced to
(during SDL_RenderPresent, when changing render targets, by updating a texture
that the batch needs, etc). This is significantly more efficient, but it can
cause problems for apps that expect to render on top of the render API's
output. As such, SDL will disable batching if a specific render backend is
requested (since this might indicate that the app is planning to use the
underlying graphics API directly). This hint can be used to explicitly request
batching in this instance. It is a contract that you will either never use the
underlying graphics API directly, or if you do, you will call SDL_RenderFlush()
before you do so any current batch goes to the GPU before your work begins. Not
following this contract will result in undefined behavior.

=item C<SDL_HINT_AUTO_UPDATE_JOYSTICKS>

A variable controlling whether SDL updates joystick state when getting input
events

This variable can be set to the following values:

=over

=item C<0>

You'll call C<SDL_JoystickUpdate()> manually

=item C<1>

SDL will automatically call C<SDL_JoystickUpdate()> (default)

=back

This hint can be toggled on and off at runtime.

=item C<SDL_HINT_AUTO_UPDATE_SENSORS>

A variable controlling whether SDL updates sensor state when getting input
events

This variable can be set to the following values:

=over

=item C<0>

You'll call C<SDL_SensorUpdate()> manually

=item C<1>

SDL will automatically call C<SDL_SensorUpdate()> (default)

=back

This hint can be toggled on and off at runtime.

=item C<SDL_HINT_EVENT_LOGGING>

A variable controlling whether SDL logs all events pushed onto its internal
queue.

This variable can be set to the following values:

=over

=item C<0>

Don't log any events (default)

=item C<1>

Log all events except mouse and finger motion, which are pretty spammy.

=item C<2>

Log all events.

=back

This is generally meant to be used to debug SDL itself, but can be useful for
application developers that need better visibility into what is going on in the
event queue. Logged events are sent through C<SDL_Log()>, which means by
default they appear on stdout on most platforms or maybe C<OutputDebugString()>
on Windows, and can be funneled by the app with C<SDL_LogSetOutputFunction()>,
etc.

This hint can be toggled on and off at runtime, if you only need to log events
for a small subset of program execution.

=item C<SDL_HINT_WAVE_RIFF_CHUNK_SIZE>

Controls how the size of the RIFF chunk affects the loading of a WAVE file.

The size of the RIFF chunk (which includes all the sub-chunks of the WAVE file)
is not always reliable. In case the size is wrong, it's possible to just ignore
it and step through the chunks until a fixed limit is reached.

Note that files that have trailing data unrelated to the WAVE file or corrupt
files may slow down the loading process without a reliable boundary. By
default, SDL stops after 10000 chunks to prevent wasting time. Use the
environment variable SDL_WAVE_CHUNK_LIMIT to adjust this value.

This variable can be set to the following values:

=over

=item C<force>

Always use the RIFF chunk size as a boundary for the chunk search

=item C<ignorezero>

Like "force", but a zero size searches up to 4 GiB (default)

=item C<ignore>

Ignore the RIFF chunk size and always search up to 4 GiB

=item C<maximum>

Search for chunks until the end of file (not recommended)

=back

=item C<SDL_HINT_WAVE_TRUNCATION>

Controls how a truncated WAVE file is handled.

A WAVE file is considered truncated if any of the chunks are incomplete or the
data chunk size is not a multiple of the block size. By default, SDL decodes
until the first incomplete block, as most applications seem to do.

This variable can be set to the following values:

=over

=item C<verystrict>

Raise an error if the file is truncated

=item C<strict>

Like "verystrict", but the size of the RIFF chunk is ignored

=item C<dropframe>

Decode until the first incomplete sample frame

=item C<dropblock>

Decode until the first incomplete block (default)

=back

=item C<SDL_HINT_WAVE_FACT_CHUNK>

Controls how the fact chunk affects the loading of a WAVE file.

The fact chunk stores information about the number of samples of a WAVE file.
The Standards Update from Microsoft notes that this value can be used to
'determine the length of the data in seconds'. This is especially useful for
compressed formats (for which this is a mandatory chunk) if they produce
multiple sample frames per block and truncating the block is not allowed. The
fact chunk can exactly specify how many sample frames there should be in this
case.

Unfortunately, most application seem to ignore the fact chunk and so SDL
ignores it by default as well.

This variable can be set to the following values:

=over

=item C<truncate>

Use the number of samples to truncate the wave data if the fact chunk is
present and valid

=item C<strict>

Like "truncate", but raise an error if the fact chunk is invalid, not present
for non-PCM formats, or if the data chunk doesn't have that many samples

=item C<ignorezero>

Like "truncate", but ignore fact chunk if the number of samples is zero

=item C<ignore>

Ignore fact chunk entirely (default)

=back

=item C<SDL_HINT_DISPLAY_USABLE_BOUNDS>

Override for C<SDL_GetDisplayUsableBounds()>

If set, this hint will override the expected results for
C<SDL_GetDisplayUsableBounds()> for display index 0. Generally you don't want
to do this, but this allows an embedded system to request that some of the
screen be reserved for other uses when paired with a well-behaved application.

The contents of this hint must be 4 comma-separated integers, the first is the
bounds x, then y, width and height, in that order.

=item C<SDL_HINT_AUDIO_DEVICE_APP_NAME>

Specify an application name for an audio device.

Some audio backends (such as PulseAudio) allow you to describe your audio
stream. Among other things, this description might show up in a system control
panel that lets the user adjust the volume on specific audio streams instead of
using one giant master volume slider.

This hints lets you transmit that information to the OS. The contents of this
hint are used while opening an audio device. You should use a string that
describes your program ("My Game 2: The Revenge")

Setting this to "" or leaving it unset will have SDL use a reasonable default:
probably the application's name or "SDL Application" if SDL doesn't have any
better information.

On targets where this is not supported, this hint does nothing.

=item C<SDL_HINT_AUDIO_DEVICE_STREAM_NAME>

Specify an application name for an audio device.

Some audio backends (such as PulseAudio) allow you to describe your audio
stream. Among other things, this description might show up in a system control
panel that lets the user adjust the volume on specific audio streams instead of
using one giant master volume slider.

This hints lets you transmit that information to the OS. The contents of this
hint are used while opening an audio device. You should use a string that
describes your what your program is playing ("audio stream" is probably
sufficient in many cases, but this could be useful for something like "team
chat" if you have a headset playing VoIP audio separately).

Setting this to "" or leaving it unset will have SDL use a reasonable default:
"audio stream" or something similar.

On targets where this is not supported, this hint does nothing.

=item C<SDL_HINT_AUDIO_DEVICE_STREAM_ROLE>

Specify an application role for an audio device.

Some audio backends (such as Pipewire) allow you to describe the role of your
audio stream. Among other things, this description might show up in a system
control panel or software for displaying and manipulating media
playback/capture graphs.

This hints lets you transmit that information to the OS. The contents of this
hint are used while opening an audio device. You should use a string that
describes your what your program is playing (Game, Music, Movie, etc...).

Setting this to "" or leaving it unset will have SDL use a reasonable default:
"Game" or something similar.

On targets where this is not supported, this hint does nothing.

=item C<SDL_HINT_ALLOW_ALT_TAB_WHILE_GRABBED>

Specify the behavior of Alt+Tab while the keyboard is grabbed.

By default, SDL emulates Alt+Tab functionality while the keyboard is grabbed
and your window is full-screen. This prevents the user from getting stuck in
your application if you've enabled keyboard grab.

The variable can be set to the following values:

=over

=item C<0>

SDL will not handle Alt+Tab. Your application is responsible for handling
Alt+Tab while the keyboard is grabbed.

=item C<1>

SDL will minimize your window when Alt+Tab is pressed (default)

=back

=item C<SDL_HINT_PREFERRED_LOCALES>

Override for SDL_GetPreferredLocales()

If set, this will be favored over anything the OS might report for the user's
preferred locales. Changing this hint at runtime will not generate a
SDL_LOCALECHANGED event (but if you can change the hint, you can push your own
event, if you want).

The format of this hint is a comma-separated list of language and locale,
combined with an underscore, as is a common format: "en_GB". Locale is
optional: "en". So you might have a list like this: "en_GB,jp,es_PT"

=back

=head2 C<:logcategory>

By default the application category is enabled at the INFO level, the assert
category is enabled at the WARN level, test is enabled at the VERBOSE level and
