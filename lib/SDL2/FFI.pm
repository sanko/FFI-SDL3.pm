    SDL_Quit();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SDL2::FFI is an L<FFI::Platypus> backed bindings to the B<S>imple
B<D>irectMedia B<L>ayer - a cross-platform development library designed to
provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics
hardware.

=head1 Initialization and Shutdown

The functions in this category are used to set SDL up for use and generally
have global effects in your program. These functions may be imported with the
C<:init> or C<:default> tag.

=head2 C<SDL_Init( ... )>

Initializes the SDL library. This must be called before using most other SDL
functions.

	SDL_Init( SDL_INIT_TIMER | SDL_INIT_VIDEO | SDL_INIT_EVENTS );

C<SDL_Init( ... )> simply forwards to calling L<< C<SDL_InitSubSystem( ...
)>|/C<SDL_InitSubSystem( ... )> >>. Therefore, the two may be used
interchangeably. Though for readability of your code L<< C<SDL_InitSubSystem(
... )>|/C<SDL_InitSubSystem( ... )> >> might be preferred.

The file I/O (for example: L<< C<SDL_RWFromFile( ... )>|/C<SDL_RWFromFile( ...
)> >>) and threading (L<< C<SDL_CreateThread( ... )>|/C<SDL_CreateThread( ...
)> >>) subsystems are initialized by default. Message boxes ( L<<
C<SDL_ShowSimpleMessageBox( ... )>|/C<SDL_ShowSimpleMessageBox( ... )> >> )
also attempt to work without initializing the video subsystem, in hopes of
being useful in showing an error dialog when SDL_Init fails. You must
specifically initialize other subsystems if you use them in your application.

Logging (such as L<< C<SDL_Log( ... )>|/C<SDL_Log( ... )> >> ) works without
initialization, too.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<flags> which may be any be imported with the L<< C<:init>|SDL2::Enum/C<:init> >> tag and may be OR'd together

=back

Subsystem initialization is ref-counted, you must call L<< C<SDL_QuitSubSystem(
... )>|/C<SDL_QuitSubSystem( ... )> >> for each L<< C<SDL_InitSubSystem( ...
)>|/C<SDL_InitSubSystem( ... )> >> to correctly shutdown a subsystem manually
(or call L<< C<SDL_Quit( )>|/C<SDL_Quit( )> >> to force shutdown). If a
subsystem is already loaded then this call will increase the ref-count and
return.

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_InitSubSystem( ... )>

Compatibility function to initialize the SDL library.

In SDL2, this function and L<< C<SDL_Init( ... )>|/C<SDL_Init( ... )> >> are
interchangeable.

	SDL_InitSubSystem( SDL_INIT_TIMER | SDL_INIT_VIDEO | SDL_INIT_EVENTS );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<flags> which may be any be imported with the L<< C<:init>|SDL2::Enum/C<:init> >> tag and may be OR'd together.

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_Quit( )>

Clean up all initialized subsystems.

	SDL_Quit( );

You should call this function even if you have already shutdown each
initialized subsystem with L<< C<SDL_QuitSubSystem( )>|/C<SDL_QuitSubSystem( )>
>>. It is safe to call this function even in the case of errors in
initialization.

If you start a subsystem using a call to that subsystem's init function (for
example L<< C<SDL_VideoInit( )>|/C<SDL_VideoInit( )> >>) instead of L<<
C<SDL_Init( ... )>|/C<SDL_Init( ... )> >> or L<< C<SDL_InitSubSystem( ...
)>|/C<SDL_InitSubSystem( ... )> >>, then you must use that subsystem's quit
function (L<< C<SDL_VideoQuit( )>|/C<SDL_VideoQuit( )> >>) to shut it down
before calling C<SDL_Quit( )>. But generally, you should not be using those
functions directly anyhow; use L<< C<SDL_Init( ... )>|/C<SDL_Init( ... )> >>
instead.

You can use this function in an C<END { ... }> block to ensure that it is run
when your application is shutdown.

=head2 C<SDL_QuitSubSystem( ... )>

Shut down specific SDL subsystems.

	SDL_QuitSubSystem( SDL_INIT_VIDEO );

If you start a subsystem using a call to that subsystem's init function (for
example L<< C<SDL_VideoInit( )> |/C<SDL_VideoInit( )> >>) instead of L<<
C<SDL_Init( ... )>|/C<SDL_Init( ... )> >> or L<< C<SDL_InitSubSystem( ...
)>|/C<SDL_InitSubSystem( ... )> >>, L<< C<SDL_QuitSubSystem( ...
)>|/C<SDL_QuitSubSystem( ... )> >> and L<< C<SDL_WasInit( ...
)>|/C<SDL_WasInit( ... )> >> will not work. You will need to use that
subsystem's quit function ( L<< C<SDL_VideoQuit( )>|/C<SDL_VideoQuit( )> >>
directly instead. But generally, you should not be using those functions
directly anyhow; use L<< C<SDL_Init( ... )>|/C<SDL_Init( ... )> >> instead.

You still need to call L<< C<SDL_Quit( )>|/C<SDL_Quit( )> >> even if you close
all open subsystems with L<< C<SDL_QuitSubSystem( ... )>|/C<SDL_QuitSubSystem(
... )> >>.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<flags> which may be any be imported with the L<< C<:init>|SDL2::Enum/C<:init> >> tag and may be OR'd together.

=back

=head2 C<SDL_WasInit( ... )>

Get a mask of the specified subsystems which are currently initialized.

	SDL_Init( SDL_INIT_VIDEO | SDL_INIT_AUDIO );
	warn SDL_WasInit( SDL_INIT_TIMER ); # false
	warn SDL_WasInit( SDL_INIT_VIDEO ); # true (32 == SDL_INIT_VIDEO)
	my $mask = SDL_WasInit( );
	warn 'video init!'  if ($mask & SDL_INIT_VIDEO); # yep
	warn 'video timer!' if ($mask & SDL_INIT_TIMER); # nope

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<flags> which may be any be imported with the L<< C<:init>|SDL2::Enum/C<:init> >> tag and may be OR'd together.

=back

If C<flags> is C<0>, it returns a mask of all initialized subsystems, otherwise
it returns the initialization status of the specified subsystems.

The return value does not include C<SDL_INIT_NOPARACHUTE>.

=head1 Configuration Variables

This category contains functions to set and get configuration hints, as well as
listing each of them alphabetically.

The convention for naming hints is C<SDL_HINT_X>, where C<SDL_X> is the
environment variable that can be used to override the default. You may import
those recognised by SDL2 with the L<< C<:hints>|SDL2::Enum/C<:hints> >> tag.

In general these hints are just that - they may or may not be supported or
applicable on any given platform, but they provide a way for an application or
user to give the library a hint as to how they would like the library to work.

=head2 C<SDL_SetHintWithPriority( ... )>

Set a hint with a specific priority.

	SDL_SetHintWithPriority( SDL_EVENT_LOGGING, 2, SDL_HINT_OVERRIDE );

The priority controls the behavior when setting a hint that already has a
value. Hints will replace existing hints of their priority and lower.
Environment variables are considered to have override priority.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<name>

the hint to set

=item C<value>

the value of the hint variable

=item C<priority>

the priority level for the hint

=back

Returns a true if the hint was set, untrue otherwise.

=head2 C<SDL_SetHint( ... )>

Set a hint with normal priority.

	SDL_SetHint( SDL_HINT_XINPUT_ENABLED, 1 );

Hints will not be set if there is an existing override hint or environment
variable that takes precedence. You can use SDL_SetHintWithPriority( ) to set
the hint with override priority instead.

Expected parameters:

=over

=item C<name>

the hint to set

=item C<value>

the value of the hint variable

=back

Returns a true value if the hint was set, untrue otherwise.

=head2 C<SDL_GetHint( ... )>

Get the value of a hint.

	SDL_GetHint( SDL_HINT_XINPUT_ENABLED );

Expected parameters:

=over

=item C<name>

the hint to query

=back

Returns the string value of a hint or an undefined value if the hint isn't set.

=head2 C<SDL_GetHintBoolean( ... )>

Get the boolean value of a hint variable.

	SDL_GetHintBoolean( SDL_HINT_XINPUT_ENABLED, 0);

Expected parameters:

=over

=item C<name>

the name of the hint to get the boolean value from

=item C<default_value>

the value to return if the hint does not exist

=back

Returns the boolean value of a hint or the provided default value if the hint
does not exist.

=head2 C<SDL_AddHintCallback( ... )>

Add a function to watch a particular hint.

	my $cb = SDL_AddHintCallback(
		SDL_HINT_XINPUT_ENABLED,
		sub {
			my ($userdata, $name, $oldvalue, $newvalue) = @_;
			...;
		},
		{ time => time( ), clicks => 3 }
	);

Expected parameters:

=over

=item C<name>

the hint to watch

=item C<callback>

a code reference that will be called when the hint value changes

=item C<userdata>

a pointer to pass to the callback function

=back

Returns a pointer to a L<FFI::Platypus::Closure> which you may pass to L<<
C<SDL_DelHintCallback( ... )>|/C<SDL_DelHintCallback( ... )> >>.

=head2 C<SDL_DelHintCallback( ... )>

Remove a callback watching a particular hint.

	SDL_AddHintCallback(
		SDL_HINT_XINPUT_ENABLED,
		$cb,
		{ time => time( ), clicks => 3 }
	);

Expected parameters:

=over

=item C<name>

the hint to watch

=item C<callback>

L<FFI::Platypus::Closure> object returned by L<< C<SDL_AddHintCallback( ...
)>|/C<SDL_AddHintCallback( ... )> >>

=item C<userdata>

a pointer to pass to the callback function

=back

=head2 C<SDL_ClearHints( )>

Clear all hints.

	SDL_ClearHints( );

This function is automatically called during L<< C<SDL_Quit( )>|/C<SDL_Quit( )>
>>.

=head1 Error Handling

Functions in this category provide simple error message routines for SDL. L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> can be called for almost all SDL
functions to determine what problems are occurring. Check the wiki page of each
specific SDL function to see whether L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )>
>> is meaningful for them or not. These functions may be imported with the
C<:error> tag.

The SDL error messages are in English.

=head2 C<SDL_SetError( ... )>

Set the SDL error message for the current thread.

Calling this function will replace any previous error message that was set.

This function always returns C<-1>, since SDL frequently uses C<-1> to signify
an failing result, leading to this idiom:

	if ($error_code) {
		return SDL_SetError( 'This operation has failed: %d', $error_code );
	}

Expected parameters:

=over

=item C<fmt>

a C<printf( )>-style message format string

=item C<@params>

additional parameters matching % tokens in the C<fmt> string, if any

=back

=head2 C<SDL_GetError( )>

Retrieve a message about the last error that occurred on the current thread.

	warn SDL_GetError( );

It is possible for multiple errors to occur before calling C<SDL_GetError( )>.
Only the last error is returned.

The message is only applicable when an SDL function has signaled an error. You
must check the return values of SDL function calls to determine when to
appropriately call C<SDL_GetError( )>. You should B<not> use the results of
C<SDL_GetError( )> to decide if an error has occurred! Sometimes SDL will set
an error string even when reporting success.

SDL will B<not> clear the error string for successful API calls. You B<must>
check return values for failure cases before you can assume the error string
applies.

Error strings are set per-thread, so an error set in a different thread will
not interfere with the current thread's operation.

The returned string is internally allocated and must not be freed by the
application.

Returns a message with information about the specific error that occurred, or
an empty string if there hasn't been an error message set since the last call
to L<< C<SDL_ClearError( )>|/C<SDL_ClearError( )> >>. The message is only
applicable when an SDL function has signaled an error. You must check the
return values of SDL function calls to determine when to appropriately call
C<SDL_GetError( )>.

=head2 C<SDL_GetErrorMsg( ... )>

Get the last error message that was set for the current thread.

	my $x;
	warn SDL_GetErrorMsg($x, 300);

This allows the caller to copy the error string into a provided buffer, but
otherwise operates exactly the same as L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError(
)> >>.

=over

=item C<errstr>

A buffer to fill with the last error message that was set for the current
thread

=item C<maxlen>

The size of the buffer pointed to by the errstr parameter

=back

Returns the pointer passed in as the C<errstr> parameter.

=head2 C<SDL_ClearError( )>

Clear any previous error message for this thread.

=head1 Log Handling

Simple log messages with categories and priorities. These functions may be
imported with the C<:logging> tag.

By default, logs are quiet but if you're debugging SDL you might want:

	SDL_LogSetAllPriority( SDL_LOG_PRIORITY_WARN );

Here's where the messages go on different platforms:

	Windows		debug output stream
	Android		log output
	Others		standard error output (STDERR)

Messages longer than the maximum size (4096 bytes) will be truncated.

=head2 C<SDL_LogSetAllPriority( ... )>

Set the priority of all log categories.

	SDL_LogSetAllPriority( SDL_LOG_PRIORITY_WARN );

=back

=head1 Querying SDL Version

These functions are used to collect or display information about the version of
SDL that is currently being used by the program or that it was compiled
against.

The version consists of three segments (C<X.Y.Z>)

=over

=item X - Major Version, which increments with massive changes, additions, and enhancements

=item Y - Minor Version, which increments with backwards-compatible changes to the major revision

=item Z - Patchlevel, which increments with fixes to the minor revision

=back

Example: The first version of SDL 2 was 2.0.0

The version may also be reported as a 4-digit numeric value where the thousands
place represents the major version, the hundreds place represents the minor
version, and the tens and ones places represent the patchlevel (update
version).

Example: The first version number of SDL 2 was 2000

=head2 C<SDL_GetVersion( ... )>

Get the version of SDL that is linked against your program.

	my $ver = SDL2::Version->new;
	SDL_GetVersion( $ver );

This function may be called safely at any time, even before L<< C<SDL_Init(
)>|/C<SDL_Init( )> >>.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<version> - An SDL2::Version object which will be filled with the proper values

=back

=head1 Display and Window Management

This category contains functions for handling display and window actions.

These functions may be imported with the C<:video> tag.

=head2 C<SDL_GetNumVideoDrivers( )>

	my $num = SDL_GetNumVideoDrivers( );

Get the number of video drivers compiled into SDL.

Returns a number >= 1 on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetVideoDriver( ... )>

Get the name of a built in video driver.

    CORE::say SDL_GetVideoDriver($_) for 0 .. SDL_GetNumVideoDrivers( ) - 1;

The video drivers are presented in the order in which they are normally checked
during initialization.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<index> - the index of a video driver

=back

Returns the name of the video driver with the given C<index>.

=cut

=head2 C<SDL_VideoInit( ... )>

Initialize the video subsystem, optionally specifying a video driver.

	SDL_VideoInit( 'x11' );

This function initializes the video subsystem, setting up a connection to the
window manager, etc, and determines the available display modes and pixel
formats, but does not initialize a window or graphics mode.

If you use this function and you haven't used the SDL_INIT_VIDEO flag with
either SDL_Init( ) or SDL_InitSubSystem( ), you should call SDL_VideoQuit( )
before calling SDL_Quit( ).

It is safe to call this function multiple times. SDL_VideoInit( ) will call
SDL_VideoQuit( ) itself if the video subsystem has already been initialized.

You can use SDL_GetNumVideoDrivers( ) and SDL_GetVideoDriver( ) to find a
specific `driver_name`.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<driver_name> - the name of a video driver to initialize, or undef for the default driver

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_VideoQuit( )>

Shut down the video subsystem, if initialized with L<< C<SDL_VideoInit(
)>|/C<SDL_VideoInit( )> >>.

	SDL_VideoQuit( );

This function closes all windows, and restores the original video mode.

=head2 C<SDL_GetCurrentVideoDriver( )>

Get the name of the currently initialized video driver.

	my $driver = SDL_GetCurrentVideoDriver( );

Returns the name of the current video driver or NULL if no driver has been
initialized.

=head2 C<SDL_GetNumVideoDisplays( )>

Get the number of available video displays.

	my $screens = SDL_GetNumVideoDisplays( );

Returns a number >= 1 or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetDisplayName( ... )>


Get the name of a display in UTF-8 encoding.

	my $screen = SDL_GetDisplayName( 0 );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<displayIndex> - the index of display from which the name should be queried

=back

Returns the name of a display or undefined for an invalid display index or
failure; call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more
information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetDisplayBounds( ... )>

Get the desktop area represented by a display.

	my $rect = SDL_GetDisplayBounds( 0 );

The primary display (C<displayIndex == 0>) is always located at 0,0.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<displayIndex> - the index of the display to query

=back

Returns the SDL2::Rect structure filled in with the display bounds on success
or a negative error code on failure; call L<< C<SDL_GetError(
)>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information.


=head2 C<SDL_GetDisplayUsableBounds( ... )>

Get the usable desktop area represented by a display.

	my $rect = SDL_GetDisplayUsableBounds( 0 );

The primary display (C<displayIndex == 0>) is always located at 0,0.

This is the same area as L<< C<SDL_GetDisplayBounds( ...
)>|/C<SDL_GetDisplayBounds( ... )> >> reports, but with portions reserved by
the system removed. For example, on Apple's macOS, this subtracts the area
occupied by the menu bar and dock.

Setting a window to be fullscreen generally bypasses these unusable areas, so
these are good guidelines for the maximum space available to a non-fullscreen
window.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<displayIndex> - the index of the display to query

=back

Returns the SDL2::Rect structure filled in with the display bounds on success
or a negative error code on failure; call L<< C<SDL_GetError(
)>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information. This function also returns
C<-1> if the parameter C<displayIndex> is out of range.

=head2 C<SDL_GetDisplayDPI( ... )>

Get the dots/pixels-per-inch for a display.

	my ( $ddpi, $hdpi, $vdpi ) = SDL_GetDisplayDPI( 0 );

Diagonal, horizontal and vertical DPI can all be optionally returned if the
appropriate parameter is non-NULL.

A failure of this function usually means that either no DPI information is
available or the C<displayIndex> is out of range.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<displayIndex> - the index of the display from which DPI information should be queried

=back

Returns C<[ddpi, hdpi, vdip]> on success or a negative error code on failure;
call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information.

C<ddpi> is the diagonal DPI of the display, C<hdpi> is the horizontal DPI of
the display, C<vdpi> is the vertical DPI of the display.

=head2 C<SDL_GetDisplayOrientation( ... )>

Get the orientation of a display.

	my $orientation = SDL_GetDisplayOrientation( 0 );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<displayIndex> - the index of the display to query

	my $modes = SDL_GetNumDisplayModes( 0 );

The C<displayIndex> needs to be in the range from C<0> to
C<SDL_GetNumVideoDisplays( ) - 1>.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<displayIndex> - the index of the display to query

=back

Returns a number >= 1 on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( > >> for more information.


=head2 C<SDL_GetDisplayMode( ... )>

Get information about a specific display mode.

	my $mode = SDL_GetDisplayMode( 0, 0 );

The display modes are sorted in this priority:

=over

=item width - largest to smallest

=item height - largest to smallest

=item bits per pixel - more colors to fewer colors

=item packed pixel layout - largest to smallest

=item refresh rate - highest to lowest

=back

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<displayIndex> - the index of the display to query

=item C<modeIndex> - the index of the display mode to query

=back

Returns an L<SDL2::DisplayMode> structure filled in with the mode at

C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetDesktopDisplayMode( ... )>

Get information about the desktop's display mode.

	my $mode = SDL_GetDesktopDisplayMode( 0 );

There's a difference between this function and L<< C<SDL_GetCurrentDisplayMode(
... )>|/C<SDL_GetCurrentDisplayMode( ... )> >> when SDL runs fullscreen and has
changed the resolution. In that case this function will return the previous
native display mode, and not the current display mode.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<displayIndex> - the index of the display to query

=back

Returns an L<SDL2::DisplayMode> structure filled in with the current display
mode on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<< C<SDL_GetError(
)>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetCurrentDisplayMode( ... )>

	my $mode = SDL_GetCurrentDisplayMode( 0 );

There's a difference between this function and L<< C<SDL_GetDesktopDisplayMode(
... )>|/C<SDL_GetDesktopDisplayMode( ... )> >> when SDL runs fullscreen and has
changed the resolution. In that case this function will return the current
display mode, and not the previous native display mode.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<displayIndex> - the index of the display to query

=back

Returns an L<SDL2::DisplayMode> structure filled in with the current display
mode on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<< C<SDL_GetError(
)>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetClosestDisplayMode( ... )>

Get the closes match to the requested display mode.

	$mode = SDL_GetClosestDisplayMode( 0, $mode );

The available display modes are scanned and he closest mode matching the
requested mode is returned. The mode format and refresh rate default to the
desktop mode if they are set to 0. The modes are scanned with size being first
priority, format being second priority, and finally checking the refresh rate.
If all the available modes are too small, then an undefined value is returned.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<displayIndex> - index of the display to query

=item C<mode> - an L<SDL2::DisplayMode> structure containing the desired display mode

=item C<closest> - an L<SDL2::DisplayMode> structure filled in with the closest match of the available display modes

	my $index = SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex( $window );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window>	- the window to query

Returns the index of the display containing the center of the window on success
or a negative error code on failure; call  L<< C<SDL_GetError(
)>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_SetWindowDisplayMode( ... )>

Set the display mode to use when a window is visible at fullscreen.

	my $ok = !SDL_SetWindowDisplayMode( $window, $mode );

This only affects the display mode used when the window is fullscreen. To
change the window size when the window is not fullscreen, use L<<
C<SDL_SetWindowSize( ... )>|/C<SDL_SetWindowSize( ... )> >>.

=head2 C<SDL_GetWindowDisplayMode( ... )>

Query the display mode to use when a window is visible at fullscreen.

	my $mode = SDL_GetWindowDisplayMode( $window );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window to query

=back

Returns a L<SDL2::DisplayMode> structure on success or a negative error code on
failure; call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more
information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetWindowPixelFormat( ... )>

Get the pixel format associated with the window.

	my $format = SDL_GetWindowPixelFormat( $window );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window to query

on failure; call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >> for more
information.

=head2 C<SDL_CreateWindow( ... )>

Create a window with the specified position, dimensions, and flags.

    my $window = SDL_CreateWindow( 'Example',
        SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED, SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED,
        1280, 720,
      	SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN
    );

C<flags> may be any of the following OR'd together:

=over

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN> - fullscreen window

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP> - fullscreen window at desktop resolution

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL> - window usable with an OpenGL context

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN> - window usable with a Vulkan instance

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_METAL> - window usable with a Metal instance

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_HIDDEN> - window is not visible

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_BORDERLESS> - no window decoration

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE> - window can be resized

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_MINIMIZED> - window is minimized

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_MAXIMIZED> - window is maximized

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_INPUT_GRABBED> - window has grabbed input focus

=item C<SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI> - window should be created in high-DPI mode if supported (>= SDL 2.0.1)

=back

C<SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN> is ignored by C<SDL_CreateWindow( ... )>. The SDL_Window is
implicitly shown if C<SDL_WINDOW_HIDDEN> is not set. C<SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN> may be
queried later using L<< C<SDL_GetWindowFlags( ... )>|/C<SDL_GetWindowFlags( ...
)> >>.

On Apple's macOS, you B<must> set the NSHighResolutionCapable Info.plist
property to YES, otherwise you will not receive a High-DPI OpenGL canvas.

If the window is created with the C<SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI> flag, its size in
pixels may differ from its size in screen coordinates on platforms with
high-DPI support (e.g. iOS and macOS). Use L<< C<SDL_GetWindowSize( ...
)>|/C<SDL_GetWindowSize( ... )> >> to query the client area's size in screen
coordinates, and L<< C<SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize( )>|/C<SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize( )>
>> or L<< C<SDL_GetRendererOutputSize( )>|/C<SDL_GetRendererOutputSize( )> >>
to query the drawable size in pixels.

If the window is set fullscreen, the width and height parameters C<w> and C<h>
will not be used. However, invalid size parameters (e.g. too large) may still
fail. Window size is actually limited to 16384 x 16384 for all platforms at
window creation.

If the window is created with any of the C<SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL> or
C<SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN> flags, then the corresponding LoadLibrary function
(SDL_GL_LoadLibrary or SDL_Vulkan_LoadLibrary) is called and the corresponding
UnloadLibrary function is called by L<< C<SDL_DestroyWindow( ...
)>|/C<SDL_DestroyWindow( ... )> >>.

If C<SDL_WINDOW_VULKAN> is specified and there isn't a working Vulkan driver,
C<SDL_CreateWindow( ... )> will fail because L<< C<SDL_Vulkan_LoadLibrary(
)>|/C<SDL_Vulkan_LoadLibrary( )> >> will fail.

If C<SDL_WINDOW_METAL> is specified on an OS that does not support Metal,
C<SDL_CreateWindow( ... )> will fail.

On non-Apple devices, SDL requires you to either not link to the Vulkan loader
or link to a dynamic library version. This limitation may be removed in a
future version of SDL.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<title> - the title of the window, in UTF-8 encoding

=item C<x> - the x position of the window, C<SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED>, or C<SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED>

=item C<w> - the width of the window, in screen coordinates

=item C<h> - the height of the window, in screen coordinates

=item C<flags> - 0, or one or more L<< C<:windowFlags>|SDL2::Enum/C<:windowFlags> >> OR'd together

Set the size of a window's client area.

	SDL_SetWindowSize( $window, 100, 100 );

The window size in screen coordinates may differ from the size in pixels, if
the window was created with C<SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI> on a platform with
high-dpi support (e.g. iOS or macOS). Use L<< C<SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize( ...
)>|C<SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize( ... )> >> or L<< C<SDL_GetRendererOutputSize( ...
)>|/C<SDL_GetRendererOutputSize( ... )> >> to get the real client area size in
pixels.

Fullscreen windows automatically match the size of the display mode, and you
should use L<< C<SDL_SetWindowDisplayMode( ... )>|/C<SDL_SetWindowDisplayMode(
... )> >> to change their size.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window to change

=item C<w> - the width of the window in pixels, in screen coordinates, must be > 0

The window size in screen coordinates may differ from the size in pixels, if
the window was created with C<SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI> on a platform with
high-dpi support (e.g. iOS or macOS). Use L<< C<SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize( ...
)>|C<SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize( ... )> >>, L<< C<SDL_Vulkan_GetDrawableSize( ...
)>|/C<SDL_Vulkan_GetDrawableSize( ... )> >>, or L<<
C<SDL_GetRendererOutputSize( ... )>|/C<SDL_GetRendererOutputSize( ... )> >> to
get the real client area size in pixels.

Note: If this function fails (returns -1), the size values will be initialized
to C<0, 0, 0, 0>, as if the window in question was borderless.

Note: This function may fail on systems where the window has not yet been
decorated by the display server (for example, immediately after calling L<<
C<SDL_CreateWindow( ...  )>|/C<SDL_CreateWindow( ...  )> >> ). It is
recommended that you wait at least until the window has been presented and
composited, so that the window system has a chance to decorate the window and
provide the border dimensions to SDL.

This function also returns C<-1> if getting the information is not supported.

=head2 C<SDL_GetWindowSurface( ... )>

Get the SDL surface associated with the window.

	my $surface = SDL_GetWindowSurface( $window );

A new surface will be created with the optimal format for the window, if
necessary. This surface will be freed when the window is destroyed. Do not free
this surface.

This surface will be invalidated if the window is resized. After resizing a
window this function must be called again to return a valid surface.

You may not combine this with 3D or the rendering API on this window.

This function is affected by C<SDL_HINT_FRAMEBUFFER_ACCELERATION>.

Expected parameters include:

=head2 C<SDL_SetWindowGrab( ... )>

Set a window's input grab mode.

	SDL_SetWindowGrab( $window, 1 );

When input is grabbed the mouse is confined to the window.

If the caller enables a grab while another window is currently grabbed, the
other window loses its grab in favor of the caller's window.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window for which the input grab mode should be set

=item C<grabbed> - a true value to grab input or a false value to release input

=back

=head2 C<SDL_SetWindowKeyboardGrab( ... )>

=head2 C<SDL_SetWindowBrightness( ... )>

Set the brightness (gamma multiplier) for a given window's display.

	my $ok = !SDL_SetWindowBrightness( $window, 2 );

Despite the name and signature, this method sets the brightness of the entire
display, not an individual window. A window is considered to be owned by the
display that contains the window's center pixel. (The index of this display can
be retrieved using L<< C<SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex( ...
)>|/C<SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex( ... )> >>.) The brightness set will not follow
the window if it is moved to another display.

Many platforms will refuse to set the display brightness in modern times. You
are better off using a shader to adjust gamma during rendering, or something
similar.

Expected parameters includes:

=over

=item C<window> - the window used to select the display whose brightness will be changed

=item C<brightness> - the brightness (gamma multiplier) value to set where 0.0 is completely dark and 1.0 is normal brightness

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetWindowBrightness( ... )>

Get the brightness (gamma multiplier) for a given window's display.

	my $gamma = SDL_GetWindowBrightness( $window );

Despite the name and signature, this method retrieves the brightness of the
entire display, not an individual window. A window is considered to be owned by
the display that contains the window's center pixel. (The index of this display
can be retrieved using L<< C<SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex( ...
)>|/C<SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex( ... )> >>.)

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window used to select the display whose brightness will be queried

=back

Returns the brightness for the display where 0.0 is completely dark and C<1.0>
is normal brightness.

=head2 C<SDL_SetWindowOpacity( ... )>

Set the opacity for a window.

	SDL_SetWindowOpacity( $window, .5 );

The parameter C<opacity> will be clamped internally between C<0.0>
(transparent) and C<1.0> (opaque).

This function also returns C<-1> if setting the opacity isn't supported.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window which will be made transparent or opaque

=item C<opacity> - the opacity value (0.0 - transparent, 1.0 - opaque)

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetWindowOpacity( ... )>

Get the opacity of a window.

	my $opacity = SDL_GetWindowOpacity( $window );

If transparency isn't supported on this platform, opacity will be reported as
1.0 without error.

The parameter C<opacity> is ignored if it is undefined.

This function also returns C<-1> if an invalid window was provided.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window to get the current opacity value from

=back

Returns the current opacity on success or a negative error code on failure;
call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_SetWindowModalFor( ... )>

Set the window as a modal for another window.

	my $ok = !SDL_SetWindowModalFor( $winodw, $parent );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<modal_window> - the window that should be set modal

=item C<parent_window> - the parent window for the modal window

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.


=head2 C<SDL_SetWindowInputFocus( ... )>

Explicitly set input focus to the window.

	SDL_SetWindowInputFocus( $window );

You almost certainly want L<< C<SDL_RaiseWindow( ... )>|/C<SDL_RaiseWindow( ...
)> >> instead of this function. Use this with caution, as you might give focus
to a window that is completely obscured by other windows.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window that should get the input focus

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_SetWindowGammaRamp( ... )>

Set the gamma ramp for the display that owns a given window.

	my $ok = !SDL_SetWindowGammaRamp( $window, \@red, \@green, \@blue );

Set the gamma translation table for the red, green, and blue channels of the
video hardware. Each table is an array of 256 16-bit quantities, representing a
mapping between the input and output for that channel. The input is the index
into the array, and the output is the 16-bit gamma value at that index, scaled
to the output color precision. Despite the name and signature, this method sets
the gamma ramp of the entire display, not an individual window. A window is
considered to be owned by the display that contains the window's center pixel.
(The index of this display can be retrieved using L<<
C<SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex( ... )>|/C<SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex( ... )> >>.)
The gamma ramp set will not follow the window if it is moved to another
display.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window used to select the display whose gamma ramp will be changed

=item C<red> - a 256 element array of 16-bit quantities representing the translation table for the red channel, or NULL

=item C<green> - a 256 element array of 16-bit quantities representing the translation table for the green channel, or NULL

=item C<blue> - a 256 element array of 16-bit quantities representing the translation table for the blue channel, or NULL

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetWindowGammaRamp( ... )>

Get the gamma ramp for a given window's display.

	my ($red, $green, $blue) = SDL_GetWindowGammaRamp( $window );

Despite the name and signature, this method retrieves the gamma ramp of the
entire display, not an individual window. A window is considered to be owned by
the display that contains the window's center pixel. (The index of this display
can be retrieved using L<< C<SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex( ...
)>|/C<SDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex( ... )> >>.)

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window used to select the display whose gamma ramp will be queried

=back

Returns three 256 element arrays of 16-bit quantities filled in with the
translation table for the red, gree, and blue channels on success or a negative
error code on failure; call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( )
for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_SetWindowHitTest( ... )>

Provide a callback that decides if a window region has special properties.

	SDL_SetWindowHitTest( $window, sub ($win, $point, $data) {
    	warn sprintf 'Click at x:%d y:%d', $point->x, $point->y;
    	...;
	});

Normally, windows are dragged and resized by decorations provided by the system
window manager (a title bar, borders, etc), but for some apps, it makes sense
to drag them from somewhere else inside the window itself; for example, one
might have a borderless window that wants to be draggable from any part, or
simulate its own title bar, etc.

This function lets the app provide a callback that designates pieces of a given
window as special. This callback is run during event processing if we need to
tell the OS to treat a region of the window specially; the use of this callback
is known as "hit testing."

Mouse input may not be delivered to your application if it is within a special
area; the OS will often apply that input to moving the window or resizing the
window and not deliver it to the application.

Specifying undef for a callback disables hit-testing. Hit-testing is disabled
by default.

Platforms that don't support this functionality will return C<-1>
unconditionally, even if you're attempting to disable hit-testing.

Your callback may fire at any time, and its firing does not indicate any
specific behavior (for example, on Windows, this certainly might fire when the
OS is deciding whether to drag your window, but it fires for lots of other
reasons, too, some unrelated to anything you probably care about B<and when the
mouse isn't actually at the location it is testing>). Since this can fire at
any time, you should try to keep your callback efficient, devoid of
allocations, etc.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window to set hit-testing on

=item C<callback> - the function to call when doing a hit-test

=item C<callback_data> - an app-defined void pointer passed to C<callback>

=back

Returns C<0> on success or C<-1> on error (including unsupported); call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_FlashWindow( ... )>

Request a window to give a signal, e.g. a visual signal, to demand attention
from the user.

	SDL_FlashWindow( $window, 10 );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window to request the flashing for

=item C<flash_count> - number of times the window gets flashed on systems that support flashing the window multiple times, like Windows, else it is ignored

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_DestroyWindow( ... )>

Destroy a window.

	SDL_DestoryWindow( $window );

If C<window> is undefined, this function will return immediately after setting
the SDL error message to "Invalid window". See L<< C<SDL_GetError(
)>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ).

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window to destroy

=back

=head2 C<SDL_IsScreenSaverEnabled( ... )>

Check whether the screensaver is currently enabled.

	my $enabled = SDL_IsScreenSaverEnabled( );

The screensaver is disabled by default since SDL 2.0.2. Before SDL 2.0.2 the
screensaver was enabled by default.

The default can also be changed using C<SDL_HINT_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER>.

Returns true if the screensaver is enabled, false if it is disabled.

=head2 C<SDL_EnableScreenSaver( ... )>

Allow the screen to be blanked by a screen saver.

	SDL_EnableScreenSaver( );


=head2 C<SDL_DisableScreenSaver( ... )>

Prevent the screen from being blanked by a screen saver.

	SDL_DisableScreenSaver( );

If you disable the screensaver, it is automatically re-enabled when SDL quits.

=head1 OpenGL Support Functions

These may be imported with the C<:opengl> tag.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_LoadLibrary( ... )>

Dynamically load an OpenGL library.

	my $ok = SDL_GL_LoadLibrary( );

This should be done after initializing the video driver, but before creating
any OpenGL windows. If no OpenGL library is loaded, the default library will be
loaded upon creation of the first OpenGL window.

If you do this, you need to retrieve all of the GL functions used in your
program from the dynamic library using L<< C<SDL_GL_GetProcAddress(
)>|/C<SDL_GL_GetProcAddress( )> >>.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<path> - the platform dependent OpenGL library name, or undef to open the default OpenGL library

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_GetProcAddress( ... )>

Get an OpenGL function by name.

	my $ptr = SDL_GL_GetProcAddress( 'glGenBuffers' );
	...; # TODO
	# TODO: In the future, this should return an XSUB loaded with FFI.

If the GL library is loaded at runtime with L<< C<SDL_GL_LoadLibrary( ...
)>|/C<SDL_GL_LoadLibrary( ... )> >>, then all GL functions must be retrieved
this way. Usually this is used to retrieve function pointers to OpenGL
extensions.

There are some quirks to looking up OpenGL functions that require some extra
care from the application. If you code carefully, you can handle these quirks
without any platform-specific code, though:

=over

=item * On Windows, function pointers are specific to the current GL context;
this means you need to have created a GL context and made it current before
calling SDL_GL_GetProcAddress( ). If you recreate your context or create a
second context, you should assume that any existing function pointers
aren't valid to use with it. This is (currently) a Windows-specific
limitation, and in practice lots of drivers don't suffer this limitation,
but it is still the way the wgl API is documented to work and you should
expect crashes if you don't respect it. Store a copy of the function
pointers that comes and goes with context lifespan.

=item * On X11, function pointers returned by this function are valid for any
context, and can even be looked up before a context is created at all. This
means that, for at least some common OpenGL implementations, if you look up
a function that doesn't exist, you'll get a non-NULL result that is _NOT_
safe to call. You must always make sure the function is actually available
for a given GL context before calling it, by checking for the existence of
the appropriate extension with L<< C<SDL_GL_ExtensionSupported( ... )>|C<SDL_GL_ExtensionSupported( ... )> >>, or verifying
that the version of OpenGL you're using offers the function as core
functionality.

=item * Some OpenGL drivers, on all platforms, B<will> return undef if a function
isn't supported, but you can't count on this behavior. Check for extensions
you use, and if you get an undef anyway, act as if that extension wasn't
available. This is probably a bug in the driver, but you can code
defensively for this scenario anyhow.

=item * Just because you're on Linux/Unix, don't assume you'll be using X11.
Next-gen display servers are waiting to replace it, and may or may not make
the same promises about function pointers.

=item * OpenGL function pointers must be declared C<APIENTRY> as in the example
code. This will ensure the proper calling convention is followed on
platforms where this matters (Win32) thereby avoiding stack corruption.

=back

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<proc> - the name of an OpenGL function

=back

Returns a pointer to the named OpenGL function. The returned pointer should be
cast to the appropriate function signature.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_UnloadLibrary( )>

Unload the OpenGL library previously loaded by L<< C<SDL_GL_LoadLibrary( ...
)>|/C<SDL_GL_LoadLibrary( ... )> >>.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_ExtensionSupported( ... )>

Check if an OpenGL extension is supported for the current context.

	my $ok = SDL_GL_ExtensionSupported( 'GL_ARB_texture_rectangle' );

This function operates on the current GL context; you must have created a
context and it must be current before calling this function. Do not assume that
all contexts you create will have the same set of extensions available, or that
recreating an existing context will offer the same extensions again.

While it's probably not a massive overhead, this function is not an O(1)
operation. Check the extensions you care about after creating the GL context
and save that information somewhere instead of calling the function every time
you need to know.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<extension> - the name of the extension to check

=back

Returns true if the extension is supported, false otherwise.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_ResetAttributes( )>

Reset all previously set OpenGL context attributes to their default values.

	SDL_GL_ResetAttributes( );

=head2 C<SDL_GL_SetAttribute( ... )>

Set an OpenGL window attribute before window creation.

	SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_RED_SIZE, 5);
	SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_GREEN_SIZE, 5);
	SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_BLUE_SIZE, 5);
	SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_DEPTH_SIZE, 16);
	SDL_GL_SetAttribute(SDL_GL_DOUBLEBUFFER, 1);

This function sets the OpenGL attribute C<attr> to C<value>. The requested
attributes should be set before creating an OpenGL window. You should use L<<
C<SDL_GL_GetAttribute( ... )>|/C<SDL_GL_GetAttribute( ... )> >> to check the
values after creating the OpenGL context, since the values obtained can differ
from the requested ones.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<attr> - an SDL_GLattr enum value specifying the OpenGL attribute to set

=item C<value> - the desired value for the attribute

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_GetAttribute( ... )>

Get the actual value for an attribute from the current context.

	my $value = SDL_GL_GetAttribute(SDL_GL_DOUBLEBUFFER);

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<attr> - an SDL_GLattr enum value specifying the OpenGL attribute to get

=back

Returns the value on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_CreateContext( ... )>

Create an OpenGL context for an OpenGL window, and make it current.

	# Window mode MUST include SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL for use with OpenGL.
	my $window = SDL_CreateWindow(
    	'SDL2/OpenGL Demo', 0, 0, 640, 480,
    	SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL|SDL_WINDOW_RESIZABLE);

	# Create an OpenGL context associated with the window
	my $glcontext = SDL_GL_CreateContext( $window );

	# now you can make GL calls.
	glClearColor( 0, 0, 0 ,1 );
	glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT );
	SDL_GL_SwapWindow( $window );

	# Once finished with OpenGL functions, the SDL_GLContext can be deleted.
	SDL_GL_DeleteContext( $glcontext );

Windows users new to OpenGL should note that, for historical reasons, GL
functions added after OpenGL version 1.1 are not available by default. Those
functions must be loaded at run-time, either with an OpenGL extension-handling
library or with L<< C<SDL_GL_GetProcAddress( ... )>|/C<SDL_GL_GetProcAddress(
... )> >> and its related functions.

SDL2::GLContext is opaque to the application.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window to associate with the context

=back

Returns the OpenGL context associated with C<window> or undef on error; call
L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more details.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_MakeCurrent( ... )>

Set up an OpenGL context for rendering into an OpenGL window.

	SDL_GL_MakeCurrent( $window, $gl );

The context must have been created with a compatible window.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window to associate with the context

=item C<context> - the OpenGL context to associate with the window

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_GetCurrentWindow( )>

Get the currently active OpenGL window.

	my $window = SDL_GL_GetCurrentWindow( );

Returns the currently active OpenGL window on success or undef on failure; call
L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_GetCurrentContext( )>

Get the currently active OpenGL context.

	my $gl = SDL_GL_GetCurrentContext( );

Returns the currently active OpenGL context or NULL on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize( ... )>

Get the size of a window's underlying drawable in pixels.

	my ($w, $h) = SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize( $window );

This returns info useful for calling C<glViewport( ... )>.

This may differ from L<< C<SDL_GetWindowSize( ... )>|/C<SDL_GetWindowSize( ...
)> >> if we're rendering to a high-DPI drawable, i.e. the window was created
with C<SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI> on a platform with high-DPI support (Apple
calls this "Retina"), and not disabled by the
C<SDL_HINT_VIDEO_HIGHDPI_DISABLED> hint.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window from which the drawable size should be queried

=back

Returns the width and height in pixels, either of which may be undefined.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_SetSwapInterval( ... )>

Set the swap interval for the current OpenGL context.

	my $ok = !SDL_GL_SetSwapInterval( 1 );

Some systems allow specifying C<-1> for the interval, to enable adaptive vsync.
Adaptive vsync works the same as vsync, but if you've already missed the
vertical retrace for a given frame, it swaps buffers immediately, which might
be less jarring for the user during occasional framerate drops. If application
requests adaptive vsync and the system does not support it, this function will
fail and return C<-1>. In such a case, you should probably retry the call with
C<1> for the interval.

Adaptive vsync is implemented for some glX drivers with
C<GLX_EXT_swap_control_tear>:
L<https://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/glx_swap_control_tear.txt> and for
some Windows drivers with C<WGL_EXT_swap_control_tear>:
L<https://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/wgl_swap_control_tear.txt>

Read more on the Khronos wiki:
L<https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Swap_Interval#Adaptive_Vsync>

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<interval> - 0 for immediate updates, 1 for updates synchronized with the vertical retrace, -1 for adaptive vsync

=back

Returns C<0> on success or C<-1> if setting the swap interval is not supported;
call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_GetSwapInterval( )>

Get the swap interval for the current OpenGL context.

	my $interval = SDL_GL_GetSwapInterval( );

If the system can't determine the swap interval, or there isn't a valid current
context, this function will return 0 as a safe default.

Returns C<0> if there is no vertical retrace synchronization, C<1> if the
buffer swap is synchronized with the vertical retrace, and C<-1> if late swaps
happen immediately instead of waiting for the next retrace; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_SwapWindow( ... )>

Update a window with OpenGL rendering.

	SDL_GL_SwapWindow( $window );

This is used with double-buffered OpenGL contexts, which are the default.

On macOS, make sure you bind 0 to the draw framebuffer before swapping the
window, otherwise nothing will happen. If you aren't using C<glBindFramebuffer(
)>, this is the default and you won't have to do anything extra.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window to change

=back

=head2 C<SDL_GL_DeleteContext( ... )>

Delete an OpenGL context.

	SDL_GL_DeleteContext( $context );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<context> - the OpenGL context to be deleted

=back

=head2 2D Accelerated Rendering

This category contains functions for 2D accelerated rendering. You may import
these functions with the C<:render> tag.

This API supports the following features:

=over

=item single pixel points

=item single pixel lines

=item filled rectangles

=item texture images

=back

All of these may be drawn in opaque, blended, or additive modes.

The texture images can have an additional color tint or alpha modulation
applied to them, and may also be stretched with linear interpolation, rotated
or flipped/mirrored.

For advanced functionality like particle effects or actual 3D you should use
SDL's OpenGL/Direct3D support or one of the many available 3D engines.

This API is not designed to be used from multiple threads, see L<SDL issue
#986|https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/986> for details.

=head2 C<SDL_GetNumRenderDrivers( )>

Get the number of 2D rendering drivers available for the current display.

	my $drivers = SDL_GetNumRenderDrivers( );

A render driver is a set of code that handles rendering and texture management
on a particular display. Normally there is only one, but some drivers may have
several available with different capabilities.

There may be none if SDL was compiled without render support.

C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetRenderDriverInfo( ... )>

Get info about a specific 2D rendering driver for the current display.

	my $info = !SDL_GetRendererDriverInfo( );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<index> - the index of the driver to query information about

=back

Returns an L<SDL2::RendererInfo> structure on success or a negative error code
on failure; call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more
information.

=head2 C<SDL_CreateWindowAndRenderer( ... )>

Create a window and default renderer.

	my ($window, $renderer) = SDL_CreateWindowAndRenderer(640, 480, 0);

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<width> - the width of the window

=item C<height> - the height of the window

=item C<window_flags> - the flags used to create the window (see L<< C<SDL_CreateWindow( ... )>|/C<SDL_CreateWindow( ... )> >>)

=back

Returns a L<SDL2::Window> and L<SDL2::Renderer> objects on success, or -1 on
error; call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more
information.

=head2 C<SDL_CreateRenderer( ... )>

Create a 2D rendering context for a window.

	my $renderer = SDL_CreateRenderer( $window, -1, 0);

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window where rendering is displayed

=item C<index> - the index of the rendering driver to initialize, or C<-1> to initialize the first one supporting the requested flags

=item C<flags> - C<0>, or one or more C<SDL_RendererFlags> OR'd together

=back

Returns a valid rendering context or undefined if there was an error; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_CreateSoftwareRenderer( ... )>

Create a 2D software rendering context for a surface.

	my $renderer = SDL_CreateSoftwareRenderer( $surface );

Two other API which can be used to create SDL_Renderer:

L<< C<SDL_CreateRenderer( ... )>|/C<SDL_CreateRenderer( ... )> >> and L<<
C<SDL_CreateWindowAndRenderer( ... )>|/C<SDL_CreateWindowAndRenderer( ... )>
>>. These can B<also> create a software renderer, but they are intended to be
used with an L<SDL2::Window> as the final destination and not an
L<SDL2::Surface>.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<surface> - the L<SDL2::Surface> structure representing the surface where rendering is done

=back

Returns a valid rendering context or undef if there was an error; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetRenderer( ... )>

Get the renderer associated with a window.

	my $renderer = SDL_GetRenderer( $window );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<window> - the window to query

=back

Returns the rendering context on success or undef on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetRendererInfo( ... )>

Get information about a rendering context.

	my $info = !SDL_GetRendererInfo( $renderer );

Expected parameters include:

on failure; call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more
information.

=head2 C<SDL_GetRendererOutputSize( ... )>

Get the output size in pixels of a rendering context.

	my ($w, $h) = SDL_GetRendererOutputSize( $renderer );

Due to high-dpi displays, you might end up with a rendering context that has
more pixels than the window that contains it, so use this instead of L<<
C<SDL_GetWindowSize( ... )>|/C<SDL_GetWindowSize( ... )> >> to decide how much
drawing area you have.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - the rendering context

=back

Returns the width and height on success or a negative error code on failure;
call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.

Create a texture for a rendering context.

    my $texture = SDL_CreateTexture( $renderer, SDL_PIXELFORMAT_RGBA8888, SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_TARGET, 1024, 768);

=for TODO: https://gist.github.com/malja/2193bd656fe50c203f264ce554919976

You can set the texture scaling method by setting
C<SDL_HINT_RENDER_SCALE_QUALITY> before creating the texture.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - the rendering context

=item C<format> - one of the enumerated values in C<:pixelFormatEnum>

=item C<access> - one of the enumerated values in C<:textureAccess>

=item C<w> - the width of the texture in pixels

=item C<h> - the height of the texture in pixels

=back

Returns a pointer to the created texture or undefined if no rendering context
was active, the format was unsupported, or the width or height were out of
range; call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more

=head2 C<SDL_SetTextureBlendMode( ... )>

Set the blend mode for a texture, used by L<< C<SDL_RenderCopy( ...
)>|/C<SDL_RenderCopy( ... )> >>.

	SDL_UpdateTexture( $texture, $rect, $surface->pixels, $surface->pitch );

The pixel data must be in the pixel format of the texture. Use L<<
C<SDL_QueryTexture( ... )>|/C<SDL_QueryTexture( ... )> >> to query the pixel
format of the texture.

This is a fairly slow function, intended for use with static textures that do
not change often.

If the texture is intended to be updated often, it is preferred to create the
texture as streaming and use the locking functions referenced below. While this
function will work with streaming textures, for optimization reasons you may
not get the pixels back if you lock the texture afterward.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<texture> - the texture to update

=item C<rect> - an L<SDL2::Rect> structure representing the area to update, or undef to update the entire texture

	SDL_UpdateYUVTexture( $texture, $rect, $yPlane, $yPitch, $uPlane, $uPitch, $vPlane, $vPitch );

You can use L<< C<SDL_UpdateTexture( ... )>|/C<SDL_UpdateTexture( ... )> >> as
long as your pixel data is a contiguous block of Y and U/V planes in the proper
order, but this function is available if your pixel data is not contiguous.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<texture> - the texture to update

=item C<rect> - a pointer to the rectangle of pixels to update, or undef to update the entire texture

=item C<Yplane> - the raw pixel data for the Y plane

=item C<Ypitch> - the number of bytes between rows of pixel data for the Y plane

=head2 C<SDL_UpdateNVTexture( ... )>

Update a rectangle within a planar NV12 or NV21 texture with new pixels.

	SDL_UpdateNVTexture( $texture, $rect, $yPlane, $yPitch, $uPlane, $uPitch );

You can use L<< C<SDL_UpdateTexture( ... )>|/C<SDL_UpdateTexture( ... )> >> as
long as your pixel data is a contiguous block of NV12/21 planes in the proper
order, but this function is available if your pixel data is not contiguous.

=item C<texture> - the texture to update

=item C<rect> - a pointer to the rectangle of pixels to update, or undef to update the entire texture.

=item C<Yplane> - the raw pixel data for the Y plane.

=head2 C<SDL_LockTexture( ... )>

Lock a portion of the texture for B<write-only> pixel access.

	SDL_LockTexture( $texture, $rect, $pixels, $pitch );

As an optimization, the pixels made available for editing don't necessarily
contain the old texture data. This is a write-only operation, and if you need
to keep a copy of the texture data you should do that at the application level.

You must use L<< C<SDL_UpdateTexture( ... )>|/C<SDL_UpdateTexture( ... )> >> to
unlock the pixels and apply any changes.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<texture> - the texture to lock for access, which was created with C<SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING>

=item C<rect> - an L<SDL2::Rect> structure representing the area to lock for access; undef to lock the entire texture

was not created with `SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING`; call L<< C<SDL_GetError(
)>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_LockTextureToSurface( ... )>

Lock a portion of the texture for B<write-only> pixel access, and expose it as
a SDL surface.

	my $surface = SDL_LockTextureSurface( $texture, $rect );

Besides providing an L<SDL2::Surface> instead of raw pixel data, this function
operates like L<SDL2::LockTexture>.

As an optimization, the pixels made available for editing don't necessarily
contain the old texture data. This is a write-only operation, and if you need
to keep a copy of the texture data you should do that at the application level.

You must use L<< C<SDL_UnlockTexture( ... )>|/C<SDL_UnlockTexture( ... )> >> to
unlock the pixels and apply any changes.

The returned surface is freed internally after calling L<< C<SDL_UnlockTexture(
... )>|/C<SDL_UnlockTexture( ... )> >> or L<< C<SDL_DestroyTexture( ...
)>|/C<SDL_DestroyTexture( ... )> >>. The caller should not free it.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<texture> - the texture to lock for access, which was created with C<SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING>

=item C<rect> - a pointer to the rectangle to lock for access. If the rect is undef, the entire texture will be locked

=back

Returns the L<SDL2::Surface> structure on success, or C<-1> if the texture is
not valid or was not created with C<SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING>.

=head2 C<SDL_UnlockTexture( ... )>

Unlock a texture, uploading the changes to video memory, if needed.

	SDL_UnlockTexture( $texture );

B<Warning>: Please note that L<< C<SDL_LockTexture( ... )>|/C<SDL_LockTexture(
... )> >> is intended to be write-only; it will not guarantee the previous
contents of the texture will be provided. You must fully initialize any area of
a texture that you lock before unlocking it, as the pixels might otherwise be
uninitialized memory.

Which is to say: locking and immediately unlocking a texture can result in
corrupted textures, depending on the renderer in use.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<texture> - a texture locked by L<< C<SDL_LockTexture( ... )>|/C<SDL_LockTexture( ... )> >>

=back

=back

Returns true if supported or false if not.

=head2 C<SDL_SetRenderTarget( ... )>

Set a texture as the current rendering target.

	SDL_SetRenderTarget( $renderer, $texture );

Before using this function, you should check the C<SDL_RENDERER_TARGETTEXTURE>
bit in the flags of L<SDL2::RendererInfo> to see if render targets are
supported.

The default render target is the window for which the renderer was created. To
stop rendering to a texture and render to the window again, call this function
with a undefined C<texture>.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - the rendering context

=item C<texture> - the targeted texture, which must be created with the C<SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_TARGET> flag, or undef to render to the window instead of a texture.

=back

=back

Returns the current render target or undef for the default render target.

=head2 C<SDL_RenderSetLogicalSize( ... )>

Set a device independent resolution for rendering.

	SDL_RenderSetLogicalSize( $renderer, 100, 100 );

This function uses the viewport and scaling functionality to allow a fixed
logical resolution for rendering, regardless of the actual output resolution.
If the actual output resolution doesn't have the same aspect ratio the output
rendering will be centered within the output display.

If the output display is a window, mouse and touch events in the window will be
filtered and scaled so they seem to arrive within the logical resolution.

If this function results in scaling or subpixel drawing by the rendering
backend, it will be handled using the appropriate quality hints.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - the renderer for which resolution should be set

=item C<w> - the width of the logical resolution

=item C<h> - the height of the logical resolution

=head2 C<SDL_RenderGetLogicalSize( ... )>

Get device independent resolution for rendering.

	my ($w, $h) = SDL_RenderGetLogicalSize( $renderer );

This may return C<0> for C<w> and C<h> if the L<SDL2::Renderer> has never had
its logical size set by L<< C<SDL_RenderSetLogicalSize( ...
)>|/C<SDL_RenderSetLogicalSize( ... )> >> and never had a render target set.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - a rendering context

=back

Returns the width and height.

=head2 C<SDL_RenderSetIntegerScale( ... )>

Set whether to force integer scales for resolution-independent rendering.

	SDL_RenderSetIntegerScale( $renderer, 1 );

rounded down to the lower multiple.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - the renderer for which integer scaling should be set

=item C<enable> - enable or disable the integer scaling for rendering

=back

	SDL_RenderGetIntegerScale( $renderer );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - the renderer from which integer scaling should be queried

=head2 C<SDL_RenderSetScale( ... )>

Set the drawing scale for rendering on the current target.

	SDL_RenderSetScale( $renderer, .5, 1 );

The drawing coordinates are scaled by the x/y scaling factors before they are
used by the renderer. This allows resolution independent drawing with a single
coordinate system.

If this results in scaling or subpixel drawing by the rendering backend, it
will be handled using the appropriate quality hints. For best results use
integer scaling factors.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - a rendering context

=item C<scaleX> - the horizontal scaling factor

        SDL_PIXELFORMAT_RGB888,
        $surface->pixels, $surface->pitch
    );

B<WARNING>: This is a very slow operation, and should not be used frequently.

C<pitch> specifies the number of bytes between rows in the destination
C<pixels> data. This allows you to write to a subrectangle or have padded rows
in the destination. Generally, C<pitch> should equal the number of pixels per
row in the `pixels` data times the number of bytes per pixel, but it might
contain additional padding (for example, 24bit RGB Windows Bitmap data pads all
rows to multiples of 4 bytes).

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<rect> - an L<SDL2::Rect> structure representing the area to read

=for TODO: or NULL for the entire render target

=item C<format> - an C<:pixelFormatEnum> value of the desired format of the pixel data, or C<0> to use the format of the rendering target

=item C<pixels> - pointer to the pixel data to copy into

=item C<pitch> - the pitch of the C<pixels> parameter

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_RenderPresent( ... )>

Update the screen with any rendering performed since the previous call.

	SDL_RenderPresent( $renderer );

SDL's rendering functions operate on a backbuffer; that is, calling a rendering
function such as L<< C<SDL_RenderDrawLine( ... )>|/C<SDL_RenderDrawLine( ... )>
>> does not directly put a line on the screen, but rather updates the
backbuffer. As such, you compose your entire scene and *present* the composed
backbuffer to the screen as a complete picture.

Therefore, when using SDL's rendering API, one does all drawing intended for
the frame, and then calls this function once per frame to present the final
drawing to the user.

The backbuffer should be considered invalidated after each present; do not
assume that previous contents will exist between frames. You are strongly
encouraged to call L<< C<SDL_RenderClear( ... )>|/C<SDL_RenderClear( ... )> >>
to initialize the backbuffer before starting each new frame's drawing, even if
you plan to overwrite every pixel.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - the rendering context

=back

=head2 C<SDL_DestroyTexture( ... )>

Destroy the specified texture.

	SDL_DestroyTexture( $texture );

Passing undef or an otherwise invalid texture will set the SDL error message to
"Invalid texture".

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<texture> - the texture to destroy

=back


=head2 C<SDL_DestroyRenderer( ... )>

Destroy the rendering context for a window and free associated textures.

	SDL_DestroyRenderer( $renderer );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - the rendering context

=back

=head2 C<SDL_RenderFlush( ... )>

Force the rendering context to flush any pending commands to the underlying
rendering API.

	SDL_RenderFlush( $renderer );

You do not need to (and in fact, shouldn't) call this function unless you are
planning to call into OpenGL/Direct3D/Metal/whatever directly in addition to
using an SDL_Renderer.

This is for a very-specific case: if you are using SDL's render API, you asked
for a specific renderer backend (OpenGL, Direct3D, etc), you set
C<SDL_HINT_RENDER_BATCHING> to "C<1>", and you plan to make OpenGL/D3D/whatever
calls in addition to SDL render API calls. If all of this applies, you should
call L<< C<SDL_RenderFlush( ... )>|/C<SDL_RenderFlush( ... )> >> between calls
to SDL's render API and the low-level API you're using in cooperation.

In all other cases, you can ignore this function. This is only here to get
maximum performance out of a specific situation. In all other cases, SDL will
do the right thing, perhaps at a performance loss.

This function is first available in SDL 2.0.10, and is not needed in 2.0.9 and
earlier, as earlier versions did not queue rendering commands at all, instead
flushing them to the OS immediately.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - the rendering context

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call L<<
C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.


=head2 C<SDL_GL_BindTexture( ... )>

Bind an OpenGL/ES/ES2 texture to the current context.

	my ($texw, $texh) = SDL_GL_BindTexture( $texture );

This is for use with OpenGL instructions when rendering OpenGL primitives
directly.

If not NULL, the returned width and height values suitable for the provided
texture. In most cases, both will be C<1.0>, however, on systems that support
the GL_ARB_texture_rectangle extension, these values will actually be the pixel
width and height used to create the texture, so this factor needs to be taken
into account when providing texture coordinates to OpenGL.

You need a renderer to create an L<SDL2::Texture>, therefore you can only use
this function with an implicit OpenGL context from L<< C<SDL_CreateRenderer(
... )>|/C<SDL_CreateRenderer( ... )> >>, not with your own OpenGL context. If
you need control over your OpenGL context, you need to write your own
texture-loading methods.

Also note that SDL may upload RGB textures as BGR (or vice-versa), and re-order
the color channels in the shaders phase, so the uploaded texture may have
swapped color channels.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<texture> - the texture to bind to the current OpenGL/ES/ES2 context

=back

Returns the texture's with and height on success, or -1 if the operation is not
supported; call L<< C<SDL_GetError( )>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more
information.

=head2 C<SDL_GL_UnbindTexture( ... )>

Unbind an OpenGL/ES/ES2 texture from the current context.

	SDL_GL_UnbindTexture( $texture );

See L<< C<SDL_GL_BindTexture( ... )>|/C<SDL_GL_BindTexture( ... )> >> for
examples on how to use these functions.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<texture> - the texture to unbind from the current OpenGL/ES/ES2 context

=back

Returns C<0> on success, or C<-1> if the operation is not supported.

=head2 C<SDL_RenderGetMetalLayer( ... )>

Get the CAMetalLayer associated with the given Metal renderer.

	my $opaque = SDL_RenderGetMetalLayer( $renderer );

This function returns C<void *>, so SDL doesn't have to include Metal's
headers, but it can be safely cast to a C<CAMetalLayer *>.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - the renderer to query

=back

Returns C<CAMetalLayer*> on success, or undef if the renderer isn't a Metal
renderer.

=head2 C<SDL_RenderGetMetalCommandEncoder( ... )>

Get the Metal command encoder for the current frame

	$opaque = SDL_RenderGetMetalCommandEncoder( $renderer );

This function returns C<void *>, so SDL doesn't have to include Metal's
headers, but it can be safely cast to an
C<idE<lt>MTLRenderCommandEncoderE<gt>>.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<renderer> - the renderer to query

=back

Returns C<idE<lt>MTLRenderCommandEncoderE<gt>> on success, or undef if the
renderer isn't a Metal renderer.





















































=head2 C<SDL_ComposeCustomBlendMode( ... )>

Compose a custom blend mode for renderers.



The functions SDL_SetRenderDrawBlendMode and SDL_SetTextureBlendMode accept the
SDL_BlendMode returned by this function if the renderer supports it.

A blend mode controls how the pixels from a drawing operation (source) get
combined with the pixels from the render target (destination). First, the
components of the source and destination pixels get multiplied with their blend
factors. Then, the blend operation takes the two products and calculates the
result that will get stored in the render target.

Expressed in pseudocode, it would look like this:

	my $dstRGB = colorOperation( $srcRGB * $srcColorFactor, $dstRGB * $dstColorFactor );
 	my $dstA   = alphaOperation( $srcA * $srcAlphaFactor, $dstA * $dstAlphaFactor );

Where the functions C<colorOperation(src, dst)> and C<alphaOperation(src, dst)>
can return one of the following:

=over

=item C<src + dst>

=item C<src - dst>

=item C<dst - src>

=item C<min(src, dst)>

=item C<max(src, dst)>

=back

The red, green, and blue components are always multiplied with the first,
second, and third components of the SDL_BlendFactor, respectively. The fourth
component is not used.

The alpha component is always multiplied with the fourth component of the L<<
C<:blendFactor>|/C<:blendFactor> >>. The other components are not used in the
alpha calculation.

Support for these blend modes varies for each renderer. To check if a specific
L<< C<:blendMode>|/C<:blendMode> >> is supported, create a renderer and pass it
to either C<SDL_SetRenderDrawBlendMode> or C<SDL_SetTextureBlendMode>. They
will return with an error if the blend mode is not supported.

This list describes the support of custom blend modes for each renderer in SDL
2.0.6. All renderers support the four blend modes listed in the L<<
C<:blendMode>|/C<:blendMode> >> enumeration.

=over

=item B<direct3d> - Supports C<SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD> with all factors.

=item B<direct3d11> - Supports all operations with all factors. However, some factors produce unexpected results with C<SDL_BLENDOPERATION_MINIMUM> and C<SDL_BLENDOPERATION_MAXIMUM>.

=item B<opengl> - Supports the C<SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD> operation with all factors. OpenGL versions 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 do not work correctly with SDL 2.0.6.

=item B<opengles> - Supports the C<SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD> operation with all factors. Color and alpha factors need to be the same. OpenGL ES 1 implementation specific: May also support C<SDL_BLENDOPERATION_SUBTRACT> and C<SDL_BLENDOPERATION_REV_SUBTRACT>. May support color and alpha operations being different from each other. May support color and alpha factors being different from each other.

=item B<opengles2> - Supports the C<SDL_BLENDOPERATION_ADD>, C<SDL_BLENDOPERATION_SUBTRACT>, C<SDL_BLENDOPERATION_REV_SUBTRACT> operations with all factors.

=item B<psp> - No custom blend mode support.

=item B<software> - No custom blend mode support.

=back

Some renderers do not provide an alpha component for the default render target.
The C<SDL_BLENDFACTOR_DST_ALPHA> and C<SDL_BLENDFACTOR_ONE_MINUS_DST_ALPHA>
factors do not have an effect in this case.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<srcColorFactor> -the C<:blendFactor> applied to the red, green, and blue components of the source pixels

=item C<dstColorFactor> - the C<:blendFactor> applied to the red, green, and blue components of the destination pixels

=item C<colorOperation> - the C<:blendOperation> used to combine the red, green, and blue components of the source and destination pixels

=item C<srcAlphaFactor> - the C<:blendFactor> applied to the alpha component of the source pixels

=item C<dstAlphaFactor> - the C<:blendFactor> applied to the alpha component of the destination pixels

=item C<alphaOperation> - the C<:blendOperation> used to combine the alpha component of the source and destination pixels

=back

Returns a C<:blendMode> that represents the chosen factors and operations.

=head1 Time Management Routines

This section contains functions for handling the SDL time management routines.
They may be imported with the C<:timer> tag.

=head2 C<SDL_GetTicks( )>

Get the number of milliseconds since SDL library initialization.

	my $time = SDL_GetTicks( );

This value wraps if the program runs for more than C<~49> days.

Returns an unsigned 32-bit value representing the number of milliseconds since
the SDL library initialized.

=head2 C<SDL_GetPerformanceCounter( )>

Get the current value of the high resolution counter.

	my $high_timer = SDL_GetPerformanceCounter( );

This function is typically used for profiling.

The counter values are only meaningful relative to each other. Differences
between values can be converted to times by using L<<
C<SDL_GetPerformanceFrequency( )>|/C<SDL_GetPerformanceFrequency( )> >>.

Returns the current counter value.

=head2 C<SDL_GetPerformanceFrequency( ... )>

Get the count per second of the high resolution counter.

	my $hz = SDL_GetPerformanceFrequency( );

Returns a platform-specific count per second.

=head2 C<SDL_Delay( ... )>

Wait a specified number of milliseconds before returning.

	SDL_Delay( 1000 );

This function waits a specified number of milliseconds before returning. It
waits at least the specified time, but possibly longer due to OS scheduling.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<ms> - the number of milliseconds to delay

=back

=head2 C<SDL_AddTimer( ... )>

Call a callback function at a future time.

   my $id = SDL_AddTimer( 1000, sub ( $interval, $data ) { warn 'ping!'; $interval; } );

If you use this function, you must pass C<SDL_INIT_TIMER> to L<< C<SDL_Init(
... )>|/C<SDL_Init( ... )> >>.

The callback function is passed the current timer interval and returns the next
timer interval. If the returned value is the same as the one passed in, the
periodic alarm continues, otherwise a new alarm is scheduled. If the callback
returns C<0>, the periodic alarm is cancelled.

The callback is run on a separate thread.

Timers take into account the amount of time it took to execute the callback.
For example, if the callback took 250 ms to execute and returned 1000 (ms), the
timer would only wait another 750 ms before its next iteration.

Timing may be inexact due to OS scheduling. Be sure to note the current time
with L<< C<SDL_GetTicks( )>|/C<SDL_GetTicks( )> >> or  L<<
C<SDL_GetPerformanceCounter( )>|/C<SDL_GetPerformanceCounter( )> >> in case
your callback needs to adjust for variances.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<interval> - the timer delay, in milliseconds, passed to C<callback>

=item C<callback> - the C<CODE> reference to call when the specified C<interval> elapses

=item C<param> - a pointer that is passed to C<callback>

=back

Returns a timer ID or C<0> if an error occurs; call L<< C<SDL_GetError(
)>|/C<SDL_GetError( )> >>( ) for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_RemoveTimer( ... )>

	SDL_RemoveTimer( $id );

Remove a timer created with L<< C<SDL_AddTimer( ... )>|/C<SDL_AddTimer( ... )>
>>.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<id> - the ID of the timer to remove

=back

Returns true if the timer is removed or false if the timer wasn't found.

=head1 Raw Audio Mixing

These methods provide access to the raw audio mixing buffer for the SDL
library. They may be imported with the C<:audio> tag.

=head2 C<SDL_GetNumAudioDrivers( )>

Returns a list of built in audio drivers, in the order that they were normally
initialized by default.

=head2 C<SDL_GetAudioDriver( ... )>

Returns an audio driver by name.

	my $driver = SDL_GetAudioDriver( 1 );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<index> - The zero-based index of the desired audio driver

=back

=head2 C<SDL_AudioInit( ... )>

Audio system initialization.

	SDL_AudioInit( 'pulseaudio' );

This method is used internally, and should not be used unless you have a
specific need to specify the audio driver you want to use. You should normally
use L<< C<SDL_Init( ... )>|/C<SDL_Init( ... )> >>.

Returns C<0> on success.

=head2 C<SDL_AudioQuit( )>

Cleaning up initialized audio system.

	SDL_AudioQuit( );

This method is used internally, and should not be used unless you have a
specific need to close the selected audio driver. You should normally use L<<
C<SDL_Quit( )>|/C<SDL_Quit( )> >>.

=head2 C<SDL_GetCurrentAudioDriver( )>

Get the name of the current audio driver.

	my $driver = SDL_GetCurrentAudioDriver( );

The returned string points to internal static memory and thus never becomes
invalid, even if you quit the audio subsystem and initialize a new driver
(although such a case would return a different static string from another call
to this function, of course). As such, you should not modify or free the
returned string.

Returns the name of the current audio driver or undef if no driver has been
initialized.

=head2 C<SDL_OpenAudio( ... )>

This function is a legacy means of opening the audio device.

    my $obtained = SDL_OpenAudio(
        SDL2::AudioSpec->new( { freq => 48000, channels => 2, format => AUDIO_F32 } ) );

This function remains for compatibility with SDL 1.2, but also because it's
slightly easier to use than the new functions in SDL 2.0. The new, more
powerful, and preferred way to do this is L<< C<SDL_OpenAudioDevice( ...
)>|/C<SDL_OpenAudioDevice( ... )> >> .

This function is roughly equivalent to:

	SDL_OpenAudioDevice( (), 0, $desired, SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_ANY_CHANGE );

With two notable exceptions:

=over

=item - If C<obtained> is undefined, we use C<desired> (and allow no changes), which
means desired will be modified to have the correct values for silence,
etc, and SDL will convert any differences between your app's specific
request and the hardware behind the scenes.

=item - The return value is always success or failure, and not a device ID, which
means you can only have one device open at a time with this function.

 * \param desired an SDL_AudioSpec structure representing the desired output
 *                format. Please refer to the SDL_OpenAudioDevice documentation
 *                for details on how to prepare this structure.
 * \param obtained an SDL_AudioSpec structure filled in with the actual
 *                 parameters, or NULL.
 * \returns This function opens the audio device with the desired parameters,
 *          and returns 0 if successful, placing the actual hardware
 *          parameters in the structure pointed to by `obtained`.
 *
 *          If `obtained` is NULL, the audio data passed to the callback
 *          function will be guaranteed to be in the requested format, and
 *          will be automatically converted to the actual hardware audio
 *          format if necessary. If `obtained` is NULL, `desired` will
 *          have fields modified.
 *
 *          This function returns a negative error code on failure to open the
 *          audio device or failure to set up the audio thread; call
 *          SDL_GetError() for more information.
