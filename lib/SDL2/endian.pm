=head1 NAME

SDL2::endian - Basic Endian-specific Values

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use SDL2 qw[:endian];

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SDL2::endian contains values which might be useful for reading and writing
endian-specific values.

=head1 Defined Values

These may be imported with the C<:endian> tag.

=head2 The two types of endianness

=over

=item C<SDL_BYTEORDER> - System's byteorder

=item C<SDL_LIL_ENDIAN> - Example little endian value to compare against

=item C<SDL_BIG_ENDIAN> - Example big endian value to compare against
