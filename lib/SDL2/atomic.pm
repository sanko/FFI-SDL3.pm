=head1 NAME

SDL2::atomic - SDL Atomic Operations

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use SDL2::FFI qw[:atomic];
	SDL_assert( 1 == 1 );
	my $test = 'nope';
	SDL_assert(
        sub {
            warn 'testing';
            my $retval = $test eq "blah";
            $test = "blah";
            $retval;
        }
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If you are not an expert in concurrent lockless programming, you should only be
using the atomic lock and reference counting functions in this file.  In all
other cases you should be protecting your data structures with full mutexes.

You can find out a little more about lockless programming and the subtle issues
that can arise here:
L<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee418650%28v=vs.85%29.aspx>

There's also lots of good information here:

=over

=item L<http://www.1024cores.net/home/lock-free-algorithms>

=item L<http://preshing.com/>

=back

These operations may or may not actually be implemented using processor
specific atomic operations. When possible they are implemented as true
processor specific atomic operations. When that is not possible the are
implemented using locks that *do* use the available atomic operations.

All of the atomic operations that modify memory are full memory barriers.

=head1 Types

=head2 C<SDL_SpinLock>

The atomic locks are efficient spinlocks using CPU instructions, but are
vulnerable to starvation and can spin forever if a thread holding a lock has
been terminated.  For this reason you should minimize the code executed inside
an atomic lock and never do expensive things like API or system calls while
holding them.

The atomic locks are not safe to lock recursively.

=head2 C<SDL2::atomic_t>

A type representing an atomic integer value.  It is a struct so people don't
accidentally use numeric operations on it.

=head1 Defines and Enum

Defines and Enumerations listed here may be imported from SDL::FFI with the
following tags:

=head2 C<:assertState>

=over

=item C<SDL_ASSERTION_RETRY> - Retry the assert immediately

=item C<SDL_ASSERTION_BREAK> - Make the debugger trigger a breakpoint

=item C<SDL_ASSERTION_ABORT> - Terminate the program

=item C<SDL_ASSERTION_IGNORE> - Ignore the assert

=item C<SDL_ASSERTION_ALWAYS_IGNORE> - Ignore the assert from now on

=back

=head1 Memory barriers

Memory barriers are designed to prevent reads and writes from being reordered
by the compiler and being seen out of order on multi-core CPUs.

A typical pattern would be for thread A to write some data and a flag, and for
thread B to read the flag and get the data. In this case you would insert a
release barrier between writing the data and the flag, guaranteeing that the
data write completes no later than the flag is written, and you would insert an
acquire barrier between reading the flag and reading the data, to ensure that
all the reads associated with the flag have completed.

In this pattern you should always see a release barrier paired with an acquire
barrier and you should gate the data reads/writes with a single flag variable.

For more information on these semantics, take a look at the blog post:
