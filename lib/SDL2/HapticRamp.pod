=head1 NAME

SDL2::HapticRamp - A structure containing a template for a Ramp effect

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use SDL2 qw[:all];
    # TODO: I need to whip up a quick example

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A SDL2::HapticRamp is exclusively for the C<SDL_HAPTIC_RAMP> effect.

The ramp effect starts at start strength and ends at end strength. It augments
in linear fashion.  If you use attack and fade with a ramp the effects get
added to the ramp effect making the effect become quadratic instead of linear.
