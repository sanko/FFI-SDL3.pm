=head1 NAME

SDL2::Image - SDL Image Loading Library

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use SDL2 qw[:image];

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This extension to SDL2 can load images as SDL surfaces and textures. The
following formats are supported:

=over

=item C<TGA> - TrueVision Targa (MUST have C<.tga>)

=item C<BMP> - Windows Bitmap (C<.bmp>)

=item C<PNM> - Portable Anymap (C<.pnm>)

=over

=item C<.pbm> - Portable BitMap (mono)

=item C<.pgm> - Portable GreyMap (256 greys)

=item C<.ppm> - Portable PixMap (full color)

=back

=item C<XPM>

X11 Pixmap (C<.xpm>) can be #included directly in code

This is NOT the same as XBM (X11 Bitmap) format, which is for monocolor images.

=item C<XCF>

GIMP native (.xcf) (XCF = eXperimental Computing Facility?) This format is
always changing, and since there's no library supplied by the GIMP project to
load XCF, the loader may frequently fail to load much of any image from an XCF
file. It's better to load this in GIMP and convert to a better supported image
format.

=item C<PCX> - ZSoft IBM PC Paintbrush (C<.pcx>)

=item C<GIF> - CompuServe Graphics Interchange Format (C<.gif>)

=item C<JPG> - Joint Photographic Experts Group JFIF format (C<.jpg> or C<.jpeg>)

=item C<TIF> - Tagged Image File Format (C<.tif> or C<.tiff>)

=item C<LBM> - Interleaved Bitmap (C<.lbm> or C<.iff>) FORM : ILBM or PBM(packed bitmap)

HAM6, HAM8, and 24bit types are not supported.

=item C<PNG> - Portable Network Graphics (C<.png>)

=back

=head1 Functions

These may be imported by name or with the C<:image> tag.

=head2 C<SDL_IMAGE_VERSION( ... )>

Macro to determine compile-time version of the SDL_image library.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<x> - a pointer to a L<SDL2::Version> struct to initialize

=back

=head2 C<SDL_IMAGE_VERSION_ATLEAST( ... )>

Evaluates to true if compiled with SDL at least C<major.minor.patch>.

	if ( SDL_IMAGE_VERSION_ATLEAST( 2, 0, 5 ) ) {
		# Some feature that requires 2.0.5+
	}

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<major>

=item C<minor>

=item C<patch>

=back

=head2 C<IMG_Linked_Version( )>

This function gets the version of the dynamically linked SDL_image library.

    my $link_version = IMG_Linked_Version();
    printf "running with SDL_image version: %d.%d.%d\n",
        $link_version->major, $link_version->minor, $link_version->patch;

It should NOT be used to fill a version structure, instead you should use the
L<< C<SDL_IMAGE_VERSION( ... )>|/C<SDL_IMAGE_VERSION( ... )> >> macro.

Returns a L<SDL2::Version> object.

=head2 C<IMG_Init( ... )>

Loads dynamic libraries and prepares them for use.

    if ( !( IMG_Init(IMG_INIT_PNG) & IMG_INIT_PNG ) ) {
        printf( "could not initialize sdl2_image: %s\n", IMG_GetError() );
        return !1;
    }

You may call this multiple times, which will actually require you to call
C<IMG_Quit( )> just once to clean up. You may call this function with a
C<flags> of C<0> to retrieve whether support was built-in or not loaded yet.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<flags>

Flags should be one or more flags from L<< C<IMG_InitFlags>|/C<IMG_InitFlags>
>> OR'd together.

=over

=item C<IMG_INIT_JPG>

=item C<IMG_INIT_PNG>

=item C<IMG_INIT_TIF>

=back

=back

Returns the flags successfully initialized, or C<0> on failure.

=head2 C<IMG_Quit( )>

Unloads libraries loaded with L<< C<IMG_Init( ... )>|/C<IMG_Init( ... )> >>.

=head2 C<IMG_LoadTyped_RW( ... )>

Load an image from an SDL data source.

    # load sample.tga into image
    my $image = IMG_LoadTyped_RW( SDL_RWFromFile( 'sample.tga', 'rb' ), 1, 'TGA' );
    if ( !$image ) {
        printf( "IMG_LoadTyped_RW: %s\n", IMG_GetError() );

        # handle error
    }

If the image format supports a transparent pixel, SDL will set the colorkey for
the surface.  You can enable RLE acceleration on the surface afterwards by
calling:

    SDL_SetColorKey( $image, SDL_RLEACCEL, $image->format->colorkey );

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<src> - The source L<SDL2::RWops> the image is to be loaded from

=item C<freesrc> - C<SDL_image> will close and free C<src> for you if this is a non-zero value

=item C<type> - a string that indicates which format type to interpret the image as

The list of the currently recognized strings includes (case is not important):

=over

=item C<BMP>

=item C<CUR>

=item C<GIF>

=item C<ICO>

=item C<JPG>

=item C<LBM>

=item C<PCX>

=item C<PNG>

=item C<PNM>

=item C<TGA>

=item C<TIF>

=item C<XCF>

=item C<XPM>

=item C<XV>

=back

=back

Returns a new L<SDL2::Surface> on success.

=head2 C<IMG_Load( ... )>

Loads a file for use as an image in a new surface.

    # load sample.png into image
    my $image = IMG_Load("sample.png");
    if ( !defined $image ) {
        printf( "IMG_Load: %s\n", IMG_GetError() );

        # handle error
    }

This actually calls L<< C<IMG_LoadTyped_RW( ... )>|/C<IMG_LoadTyped_RW( ... )>
>>, with the file extension used as the type string. This can load all
supported image files, including TGA as long as the filename ends with C<.tga>.
It is best to call this outside of event loops, and rather keep the loaded
images around until you are really done with them, as disk speed and image
conversion to a surface is not that speedy. Don't forget to C<SDL_FreeSurface(
... )> the returned surface pointer when you are through with it.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<file> - image file name to load a surface from

=back

Returns a new L<SDL2::Surface> on success.

=head2 C<IMG_Load_RW( ... )>

Load an image C<src> for use as a surface.

    # load sample.png in to image
    my $image = IMG_Load_RW( SDL_RWFromFile( "sample.png", "rb" ), 1 );
    if ( !$image ) {
        printf( "IMG_Load_RW: %s\n", IMG_GetError() );

        # handle error
    }

This can load all supported image formats, B<except TGA>.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<src> - The source L<SDL2::RWops> the image is to be loaded from

=item C<freesrc> - C<SDL_image> will close and free C<src> for you if this is a non-zero value

=back

Returns a new L<SDL2::Surface> on success.

=head2 C<IMG_LoadTexture( ... )>

Load an image C<file> for use as a texture.

    # load sample.png in to texture
    my $texture = IMG_LoadTexture( $renderer, "sample.png" );
    if ( !$texture ) {
        printf( "IMG_LoadTexture: %s\n", IMG_GetError() );

        # handle error
    }

Expected parameters include:

=over

        = IMG_LoadTextureTyped_RW( $renderer, SDL_RWFromFile( 'sample.png', 'rb' ), 1, 'PNG' );
    if ( !$texture ) {
