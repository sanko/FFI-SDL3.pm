=head1 NAME

SDL3::TTF::Font - A Rectangle with the Origin at the Upper Left in Integers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use SDL3::TTF qw[:all];
    TTF_Init( );
    # load font.ttf at size 16 into font
    my $font = TTF_OpenFont( 'path/to/your/font.ttf', 16 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SDL3::TTF::Font is an opaque holder of a loaded font.

This stores the font data in a struct that is exposed only by using the API
functions to get information. You should not try to access the struct data
directly, since the struct may change in different versions of the API, and
thus your program would be unreliable.
