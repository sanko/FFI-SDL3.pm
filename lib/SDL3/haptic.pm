=head1 NAME

SDL3::haptic - SDL Haptic Subsystem Allowing You to Control Haptic (Force
Feedback) Devices

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use SDL3 qw[:haptic];

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The SDL haptic subsystem allows you to control haptic (force feedback) devices.

The basic usage is as follows:

=over

=item - Initialize the subsystem (C<SDL_INIT_HAPTIC>).

=item - Open a haptic device.

=over

=item - L<< C<SDL_HapticOpen( ... )>|/C<SDL_HapticOpen( ... )> >> to open from index.

=item - L<< C<SDL_HapticOpenFromJoystick( ... )>|/C<SDL_HapticOpenFromJoystick( ... )> >> to open from an existing joystick.

=back

=item - Create an effect (C<SDL_HapticEffect>).

=item - Upload the effect with L<< C<SDL_HapticNewEffect( ... )>|/C<SDL_HapticNewEffect( ... )> >>.

=item - Run the effect with L<< C<SDL_HapticRunEffect( ... )>|/C<SDL_HapticRunEffect( ... )> >>.

=item - (optional) Free the effect with L<< C<SDL_HapticDestroyEffect( ... )>|/C<SDL_HapticDestroyEffect( ... )> >>.

=item - Close the haptic device with L<< C<SDL_HapticClose( ... )>|/C<SDL_HapticClose( ... )> >>.

=back

Simple rumble example:

    # Open the device
    my $haptic = SDL_HapticOpen( 0 );
    $haptic // return -1;

    # Initialize simple rumble
    return -1 if SDL_HapticRumbleInit( $haptic ) != 0;

    # Play effect at 50% strength for 2 seconds
    return -1 if SDL_HapticRumblePlay( $haptic, 0.5, 2000 ) != 0;
    SDL_Delay( 2000 );

    # Clean up
    SDL_HapticClose( $haptic );

Complete example:

    sub test_haptic ($joystick) {
        my $effect_id;

        # Open the device
        my $haptic = SDL_HapticOpenFromJoystick($joystick);
        $haptic // return -1;    # Most likely joystick isn't haptic

        # See if it can do sine waves
        if ( ( SDL_HapticQuery($haptic) & SDL_HAPTIC_SINE ) == 0 ) {
            SDL_HapticClose($haptic);    # No sine effect
            return -1;
        }

        # Create the effect
        my $effect = SDL3::HapticEffect->new();
        $effect->type(SDL_HAPTIC_SINE);
        $effect->periodic->direction->type(SDL_HAPTIC_POLAR);   # Polar coordinates
        $effect->periodic->direction->dir->[0] = 18000;         # Force comes from south
        $effect->periodic->period(1000);                        # 1000 ms
        $effect->periodic->magnitude(20000);                    # 20000/32767 strength
        $effect->periodic->length(5000);                        # 5 seconds long
        $effect->periodic->attack_length(1000);                 # Takes 1 second to get max strength
        $effect->periodic->fade_length(1000);                   # Takes 1 second to fade away

        #  Upload the effect
        $effect_id = SDL_HapticNewEffect( $haptic, \$effect );

        # Test the effect
        SDL_HapticRunEffect( $haptic, $effect_id, 1 );
        SDL_Delay(5000);                                        # Wait for the effect to finish

        # We destroy the effect, although closing the device also does this
        SDL_HapticDestroyEffect( $haptic, $effect_id );

        # Close the device
        SDL_HapticClose($haptic);
        return 0;                                               # Success
    }

=head1 Functions

These may be imported by name or with the C<:haptic> tag.

=head2 C<SDL_NumHaptics( ... )>

Count the number of haptic devices attached to the system.

Returns the number of haptic devices detected on the system or a negative error
code on failure; call C<SDL_GetError( )> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_HapticName( ... )>

Get the implementation dependent name of a haptic device.

This can be called before any joysticks are opened. If no name can be found,
this function returns C<undef>.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<device_index> - index of the device to query

=back

Returns the name of the device or C<undef> on failure; call C<SDL_GetError( )>
for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_HapticOpen( ... )>

Open a haptic device for use.

The index passed as an argument refers to the N'th haptic device on this
system.

When opening a haptic device, its gain will be set to maximum and autocenter
will be disabled. To modify these values use L<< C<SDL_HapticSetGain( ...
)>|/C<SDL_HapticSetGain( ... )> >> and L<< C<SDL_HapticSetAutocenter( ...
)>|/C<SDL_HapticSetAutocenter( ... )> >>.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<device_index> - index of the device to open

=back

Returns the device identifier or C<undef> on failure; call C<SDL_GetError( )>
for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_HapticOpened( ... )>

Check if the haptic device at the designated index has been opened.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<device_index> - the index of the device to query

=back

Returns C<1> if it has been opened, C<0> if it hasn't or on failure; call
C<SDL_GetError( )> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_HapticIndex( ... )>

Get the index of a haptic device.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<haptic> - the L<SDL3::Haptic> device to query

=back

Returns the index of the specified haptic device or a negative error code on
failure; call C<SDL_GetError( )> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_MouseIsHaptic( )>

Query whether or not the current mouse has haptic capabilities.

Returns C<SDL_TRUE> if the mouse is haptic or C<SDL_FALSE> if it isn't.

=head2 C<SDL_HapticOpenFromMouse( )>

Try to open a haptic device from the current mouse.

negative error code on failure; call C<SDL_GetError( )> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_HapticOpenFromJoystick( ... )>

Open a haptic device for use from a joystick device.

You must still close the haptic device separately. It will not be closed with
the joystick.

When opened from a joystick you should first close the haptic device before
closing the joystick device. If not, on some implementations the haptic device
will also get unallocated and you'll be unable to use force feedback on that
device.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<joystick> - the L<SDL3::Joystick> to create a haptic device from

=back

Returns a valid haptic device identifier on success or C<undef> on failure;

=back

=head2 C<SDL_HapticNumEffects( ... )>

Get the number of effects a haptic device can store.

On some platforms this isn't fully supported, and therefore is an
approximation. Always check to see if your created effect was actually created
and do not rely solely on SDL_HapticNumEffects().

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<haptic> - the L<SDL3::Haptic> device to query

Can be used dynamically, although behavior when dynamically changing direction
may be strange. Specifically the effect may re-upload itself and start playing
from the start. You also cannot change the type either when running L<<
C<SDL_HapticUpdateEffect( ... )>|/C<SDL_HapticUpdateEffect( ... )> >>.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<haptic> - the L<SDL3::Haptic> device that has the effect

=item C<effect> - the identifier of the effect to update

=item C<data> - an L<SDL3::HapticEffect> structure containing the new effect properties to use

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call
C<SDL_GetError( )> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_HapticRunEffect( ... )>

Run the haptic effect on its associated haptic device.

To repeat the effect over and over indefinitely, set C<iterations> to
C<SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY>. (Repeats the envelope - attack and fade.) To make one
instance of the effect last indefinitely (so the effect does not fade), set the
effect's `length` in its structure/union to C<SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY> instead.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<haptic> - the L<SDL3::Haptic> device to run the effect on

=item C<effect> - the ID of the haptic effect to run

=item C<iterations> - the number of iterations to run the effect; use C<SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY> to repeat forever

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call
C<SDL_GetError( )> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_HapticStopEffect( ... )>

Stop the haptic effect on its associated haptic device.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<haptic> - the SDL_Haptic device to stop the effect on

=item C<effect> - the ID of the haptic effect to stop

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call
C<SDL_GetError( )> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_HapticDestroyEffect( ... )>

Destroy a haptic effect on the device.

This will stop the effect if it's running. Effects are automatically destroyed
when the device is closed.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<haptic> - the L<SDL3::Haptic> device to destroy the effect on

=item C<effect> - the ID of the haptic effect to destroy

=back

=head2 C<SDL_HapticGetEffectStatus( ... )>

Get the status of the current effect on the specified haptic device.

Device must support the C<SDL_HAPTIC_STATUS> feature.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<haptic> - the L<SDL3::Haptic> device to query for the effect status on

=item C<effect> - the ID of the haptic effect to query its status

=back

Returns C<0> if it isn't playing, C<1> if it is playing, or a negative error
code on failure; call C<SDL_GetError( )> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_HapticSetGain( ... )>

Set the global gain of the specified haptic device.

Device must support the C<SDL_HAPTIC_GAIN> feature.

The user may specify the maximum gain by setting the environment variable
C<SDL_HAPTIC_GAIN_MAX> which should be between C<0> and C<100>. All calls to
L<< C<SDL_HapticSetGain( ... )>|/C<SDL_HapticSetGain( ... )> >> will scale
linearly using C<SDL_HAPTIC_GAIN_MAX> as the maximum.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<haptic> - the L<SDL3::Haptic> device to set the gain on

=item C<gain> - value to set the gain to, should be between C<0> and C<100>

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call
C<SDL_GetError( )> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_HapticSetAutocenter( ... )>

Set the global autocenter of the device.

Autocenter should be between 0 and 100. Setting it to 0 will disable
autocentering.

Device must support the C<SDL_HAPTIC_AUTOCENTER> feature.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<haptic> - the L<SDL3::Haptic> device to set autocentering on

=item C<autocenter> - value to set autocenter to (0-100)

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call
C<SDL_GetError( )> for more information.

=head2 C<SDL_HapticPause( ... )>

Pause a haptic device.

Device must support the C<SDL_HAPTIC_PAUSE> feature. Call L<<
C<SDL_HapticUnpause( ... )>|/C<SDL_HapticUnpause( ... )> >> to resume playback.

Do not modify the effects nor add new ones while the device is paused. That can
cause all sorts of weird errors.

Expected parameters include:

=over

=item C<haptic> - the L<SDL3::Haptic> device to pause

=back

Returns C<0> on success or a negative error code on failure; call
C<SDL_GetError( )> for more information.
