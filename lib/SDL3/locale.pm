=head1 NAME

SDL3::locale - SDL Locale Services

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use SDL3 qw[:locale];
    my $locale = SDL_GetPreferredLocales( )->[0];

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SDL3::locale represents the user's preferred locale.

=head1 Functions

These may be imported by name or with the C<:locale> tag.

=head2 C<SDL_GetPreferredLocales( )>

Report the user's preferred locale.

	my $locale = SDL_GetPreferredLocales( )->[0];
	warn $locale->language;
	warn $locale->country;

This returns an array of L<SDL3::Locale> structs, the final item zeroed out.

Returned language strings are in the format xx, where 'xx' is an ISO-639
language specifier (such as "en" for English, "de" for German, etc). Country
strings are in the format YY, where "YY" is an ISO-3166 country code (such as
"US" for the United States, "CA" for Canada, etc). Country might be NULL if
there's no specific guidance on them (so you might get C<{ "en", "US" }> for
American English, but C<{ "en", undef }> means "English language,
generically"). Language strings are never C<undef>, except to terminate the
array.

Please note that not all of these strings are 2 characters; some are three or
more.

The returned list of locales are in the order of the user's preference. For
example, a German citizen that is fluent in US English and knows enough
Japanese to navigate around Tokyo might have a list like: C<[ "de", "en_US",
"jp", undef ]>. Someone from England might prefer British English (where
"color" is spelled "colour", etc), but will settle for anything like it: C<[
"en_GB", "en", undef ]>.

This function returns C<undef> on error, including when the platform does not
supply this information at all.

This might be a "slow" call that has to query the operating system. It's best
to ask for this once and save the results. However, this list can change,
usually because the user has changed a system preference outside of your
program; SDL will send an C<SDL_LOCALECHANGED> event in this case, if possible,
and you can call this function again to get an updated copy of preferred
locales.

Returns L<an array|FFI::C::Array> of locales, terminated with a locale with an
C<undef> language field. Will return C<undef> on error.
