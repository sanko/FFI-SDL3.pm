=head1 NAME

SDL3::HapticCustom - A structure containing a template for a Custom effect

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use SDL3 qw[:all];
    # TODO: I need to whip up a quick example

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A SDL3::HapticCustom is exclusively for the C<SDL_HAPTIC_CUSTOM> effect.

A custom force feedback effect is much like a periodic effect, where the
application can define its exact shape.  You will have to allocate the data
yourself.  Data should consist of channels * samples Uint16 samples.

If channels is one, the effect is rotated using the defined direction.
Otherwise it uses the samples in data for the different axes.
